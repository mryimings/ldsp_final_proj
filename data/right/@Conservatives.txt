Labour have consistently supported higher local taxes and deliver poorer quality local services. If you want better services and lower taxes you need a Conservative council. #PMQs https://t.co/MUoBdk91Ed
Want to know what we're doing to support our NHS? Watch this: 

#PMQs https://t.co/Xbb7CW3URH
We know that the best way to support the NHS is through building a stronger economy. Since 2010 we’ve increased NHS spending every year and funding in real terms on the health service will be around £13 billion higher this year than when we came to office. #PMQs
We're committed to ensuring that 70,000 more children and young people each year will have access to high-quality NHS mental healthcare by 2020-21 and are making available an additional £1.4 billion to improve children and young people’s mental health services. #PMQs
We’re committed to seeing mental health services improve on the ground. This is backed with a significant increase in funding – spending on mental health has increased to a record £11.6 billion, with a further £1 billion by 2020/21. #PMQs
Since taking control of Dudley council we've:

In her speech today @theresa_may set out how the Government is rewriting the rules on planning. We're giving councils and developers the backing they need to get more homes built more quickly to make sure everyone has a place to call their own. https://t.co/6wiatW5whg
.@theresa_may: "More home ownership. A rental market that works for tenants. Greater fairness for all . . . as Prime Minister, that is what I am determined to deliver."
.@theresa_may: "We pledged in our manifesto to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminate it altogether by 2027. We’ve already committed £1 billion to help bring this about, and are piloting the Housing First approach in three of our great cities".
.@theresa_may: "This government is taking action to clean up the rental market and bring down the cost of renting . . . we’re banning letting agents from charging most tenants any fees at all".
.@theresa_may: "Whether you’re renting by choice or necessity, you’re not any less of a person for doing so and you should not be treated as such".
.@theresa_may: "Our 25-year environment plan commits us to leaving the natural environment in a better state than we found it. So we’ll expect any development, whether in the Green Belt or outside it, to look first at sites that have previously been built on".
.@theresa_may: "Where cities surrounded by Green Belts need more homes, we can increase housing density, make better use of brownfield sites, build upwards rather than outwards. Our new planning rules make it easier to do this".
.@theresa_may: "The Government will make sure land is available for homes and make sure our young people have the skills needed to build them. In return, I expect developers to do their duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs".
.@theresa_may: "The gap between permissions granted and homes built is still too large. The new, fairer planning rules we’re publishing today will help to close it. But it’s also time for builders and developers to step up and do their bit".
.@theresa_may: "The £5 billion Housing Infrastructure Fund has already made its first awards, investing almost £900 million in the roads, cycle paths, flood defences and other essential works that will allow for the construction of up to 200,000 homes".
.@theresa_may: "The Government must also step in if homes are going to get built. So we’re committing at least £44 billion of capital funding, loans and guarantees to support our housing market".
.@theresa_may: "[People] want to know that any new homes will be accompanied by appropriate new facilities and infrastructure. Under our new planning rules, that’s exactly what will happen".
.@theresa_may: "this Government is rewriting the rules on planning. With the major overhaul being published today, we’re giving councils and developers the backing they need to get more homes built more quickly".
.@theresa_may: "Planning professionals may not be as visible as the bricklayers and carpenters and roofers. But we cannot build the homes we need without them".
.@theresa_may: "I still vividly remember the first home I shared with my husband, Philip. Not only our pictures on the walls and our books on the shelves, but also the security that came from knowing we couldn’t be asked to move on at short notice".

PM: So join me on this journey. Come with me as I lead Britain. Strengthen my hand as I fight for Britain. https://t.co/EyLQ5pkTJl
That is the goal. This is the plan. And now is the time.
A stronger, fairer, more prosperous Britain that works for everyone, not just a privileged few.
And confident in the belief that we have the vision, the plan and the will to use this moment to build a better Britain.
With a resolute determination to get on with the job of delivering Brexit. Optimism that I can get a deal that works for all.
So I offer myself as your Prime Minister.
And after all that has passed, that is a vision of the future that can bring us together.
Every vote for me and my team will be a vote for a stronger, fairer, more prosperous Britain.
Because every vote for me and my team in this election will strengthen my hand in the negotiations to come.
Now more than ever, Britain needs a clear plan and the determination and the will to see it through.
We need that strong and stable leadership now more than ever.
Tackling the long-term challenges we face, and ensuring everyone in our country has the chance to get on in life.
But most importantly, the Government I lead will provide strong and stable leadership to see us through Brexit and beyond.
Record &amp; fair school funding. Real technical education for young people. And the first ever proper plan to pay for &amp; provide social care.
It’s why the Government I lead will build a Britain in which the economy is strong to support world-class public services.
Why we will help those struggling to afford a home of their own by building more affordable homes.
Why the Government I lead will keep taxes low &amp; cap rip-off energy tariffs to help families working all the hours they can to pay the bills.
Why the Government I lead will build a Britain in which work pays, with a higher National Living Wage &amp; proper rights &amp; protections at work.
That is why the Government I lead will ensure every area of this United Kingdom is able to prosper.
A force that steps up and acts in the interests of ordinary working people.
For while it is never true that government has all the answers, government can and should be a force for good.
And they look to their government for help and support. This party – the Conservative and Unionist Party – will be that government.
They just want to get on with their lives, to do their best for their children, and to be given a fair chance.
For too many people in Britain today, life is simply much harder than many seem to think or realise.
If we get Brexit right, we can use this moment of change to build a stronger, fairer, more prosperous Britain here at home. https://t.co/nk9883flRm
We'll make the decisions that matter to Britain here in Britain https://t.co/r6UQA6PvrC
So we will leave the European Union and take control of our money, take control of our borders and take control of our laws.
The British people made their choice. I respect that. I respect the view of other European leaders who agree we can’t be half-in, half-out.
That is why I have been clear that we do not seek to fudge this issue - to be half-in and half-out of the EU.

That is the essence of American leadership &amp; as Iran now knows, the U.S is leading on the world stage for freedom. Read my op-ed here: https://t.co/E4GCzZm3eH https://t.co/SMBqrAgpi4
This morning the stock market hit yet another historic high. It’s clear that @POTUS Trump’s America First agenda is WORKING for the American people, creating more jobs, and strengthening the American economy. #MAGA #Dow25K https://t.co/gbXg1V06JJ
The U.S has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Unfortunately, many of our European partners, as well as the United Nations, have thus far failed to forcefully speak out on the growing crisis in Iran. It’s time for them to stand up. 

Read my op-ed here: https://t.co/9aPzsxAGuD
Today, the Iranian people are once again rising up to demand freedom and opportunity, and under @POTUS Trump, the United States is standing with them. This time, we will not be silent. 

Read my op-ed in the @WashingtonPost: https://t.co/9aPzsxAGuD
.@VOANews: "2018 vs 2009: The Trump administration's quick embrace of the Iran demonstrations contrasts with the Obama administration's more muted response to street protests in 2009 that lasted for months before dissipating under a deadly gov't crackdown" https://t.co/TXjjvgli24
.@POTUS Trump made it clear: America will not be bullied, America will not be threatened, and the United States of America has managed to marshal an unprecedented amount of economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. https://t.co/L0kK52AYuY
The United States of America is going to continue to send an unambiguous message that the American people stand with freedom-loving people in Iran and around the world. #IranProtests https://t.co/o5JmgsVzPE
I remember in 2009 people in Iran demonstrating incredible courage for a democratic &amp; free future. We looked to the White House in 2009 for American leadership &amp; there was none. Today the U.S stands w/ Iranians who want a better, more prosperous &amp; freer future. #IranProtests https://t.co/dyYsr5wuaE
Under @POTUS Trump, the people of Iran are not alone. The American people stand with them.  And if they will just continue to show the courage of their convictions and reach out and embrace a free and democratic future, America and the world will be with them. #IranProtests https://t.co/RmtM8QgRlY
Great to catch up with two of my predecessors -- Vice Presidents @JoeBiden &amp; Walter Mondale on Capitol Hill earlier today. Every day I am humbled and honored by the opportunity to hold this office. https://t.co/NeQ4Po8qly
My hope is that the people of Iran understand that the U.S &amp; the people of this country are their natural ally. We want to see them achieve a free and democratic future. We want to see them step away from a regime that continues to menace &amp; threaten the world. #IranProtests
The contrast between the silence and the failure to support freedom in the last administration, and @POTUS Trump's unapologetic willingness to stand w/ the courageous people of Iran - I know it is giving hope to the people on the streets of those cities across Iran. #IranProtests
Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. To see the people of Iran rising up to demand change in their country should hearten every freedom-loving American and people who cherish freedom around the world. #IranProtests
As I told @Greta during our interview for @VOAnews, the clear affirmation &amp; support that @POTUS Trump has provided to protestors rising up in cities across Iran is dramatic &amp; consistent with America's role in the world as a leading champion of freedom. #IranProtests

2) We’ll make the tax code simple &amp; fair
3) We’re gonna make U.S companies competitive again

Deeply humbling for me to stand before so many heroes at Arlington Cemetery this morning. Our nation owes a debt to our veterans, and it is a debt we can never fully repay - but on this Veterans Day, and every day, we will strive to do just that. https://t.co/VJBViW2WyR
Find a veteran and say, thank you for your service. Thank them for their courage. Thank them for your freedom. And thank them for doing their part to preserve this last best hope of Earth, for ourselves, and our posterity. #VeteransDay https://t.co/oeX0tC19H6

Words fail when saints and heroes fall. We gathered last night to extend our deepest sympathies to the families of the fallen &amp; injured. The Bible tells us that, “The Lord is close to the broken-hearted" &amp; that will be our prayer for them from this day forward. #SutherlandSprings https://t.co/PA0IJevCps

I hope that Americans of every background &amp; belief will send a chorus of prayers from their hearts into the heart of heaven for these families, for #SutherlandSprings community &amp; for this land https://t.co/n7Z1voJEHb
We come together as one nation and one people to support our fellow Americans in their hour of need. Faith is stronger than evil. No attack, no act of violence will ever break our spirit or diminish the faith of the American people. https://t.co/pCny5hqVkf

And thank you to the heroic actions of neighbors, law enforcement &amp; the first responders who saved lives by their swift action on Sunday. #SutherlandSprings https://t.co/c3QDn83Gfr
As @POTUS Trump said, “In dark times like these…we pull together, we join hands, we lock arms, &amp; through the tears &amp; the sadness, we stand strong.” We do this because that’s what Americans always do. We come together as one nation and as one people. #SutherlandSprings https://t.co/0oSCj2Jjfm

Our tax-cut plan has the potential to generate sustained economic growth of 3% or higher and spark a "middle class miracle.” #PenceatAEI
As @POTUS has said, we’re calling our plan the American model—that’s pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, and pro-family. #PenceatAEI
.@POTUS Trump is committed to signing the largest tax cut in American history—and we’ll do it before the end of this year. #PenceatAEI
As I’ve traveled across the US, working families &amp; job creators tell me one of the biggest obstacles to their success is our broken tax code
As @POTUS Trump has said, our economy cannot take off unless we transform America’s outdated, complex and burdensome tax code. #PenceatAEI
Before this year is out, we’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. #PenceatAEI
In the first 9 months of our admin, @POTUS has taken decisive action to restore freedom, opportunity &amp; prosperity for Americans. #PenceatAEI

The war on terror began 34 years ago today—&amp; at this very hour, on the frontiers of freedom, brave Americans continue to fight and sacrifice https://t.co/JI56uBqbSe
Today, and every day, we can take comfort in the knowledge that God above was, and is, and ever will be, Semper Fidelis.
We renew our pledge that their sacrifice will not have been in vain—and resolve that we’ll drive the cancer of terrorism from earth’s face.
Even today, we grieve the loss of four American heroes who fell in Niger earlier this month, and we honor their service and sacrifice.
Today, thanks to the courage of our Armed Forces and the resolve of their Commander-in-Chief @POTUS Trump, ISIS is on the run.
Just last week, American and Allied Forces liberated Raqqa—and across Syria and Iraq, the caliphate is crumbling.
They proclaimed the start of a 1,000 year caliphate as they raised their black flags across the region–but today those flags no longer fly.
Three years ago, barbarians celebrated in the streets of their self-declared capital, in Raqqa.
This brutal act was perpetrated by Hezbollah, &amp; under @POTUS Trump, we’ve redoubled our commitment to cripple Hezbollah’s terrorist network.
At this very hour, around the globe, thousands of brave Americans are defending our freedom from the forces of terror.
The Beirut Barracks Bombing was an opening salvo in a war that we have waged ever since – the global war on terror.
@MBWDC Thirty-four years ago today, America was thrust into a war, with an enemy unlike any we had ever faced.

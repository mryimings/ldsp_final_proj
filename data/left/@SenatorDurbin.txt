We can't let the second act be pillaging from the programs (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) that actually help low and middle income Americans the most in the false name of fiscal responsibility.
The devastating first act of the #GOPTaxScam and phony fiscal conservatism has been to explode our nation’s deficit to provide enormous benefit to the rich and powerful.
The GOP treated our tax dollars like monopoly money. This debt is a burden we will be passing onto our children and it'll take generations to pay it off. #TaxDay.
The CBO has predicted the #GOPTaxScam would cost us roughly $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. So much for the GOP’s promise that these tax cuts would pay for themselves. #TaxDay.
It doesn’t stop there. More than 100,000 employees at large corporations have lost their jobs. Remind me how this bill was supposed to bring about tax relief for working families? #TaxDay
They took their tax-payer funded tax cut, turned right around &amp; gave their wealthy CEOs &amp; shareholders a raise. In 2018, large corporations have announced over $235 billion in share buybacks – far outpacing the rate of companies announcing one-time bonuses for workers. #TaxDay

Let’s come together and work on bipartisan ideas to improve upon the law and make the next 8 years even better than the last.
Despite GOP attempts to rip health care away from 20 million Americans (and their ongoing sabotage efforts which are driving up premiums), this law turns 8 today.
Health plans must cover basic, important health care needs – from doctor and hospital visits, to prescription drugs, to mental health and substance abuse treatment.
Insurance companies can no longer deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition … and they can’t impose lifetime/annual caps on your benefits.
The Affordable Care Act turns 8 years old today.
 
Because of this law, more than 20 million people have gained health insurance (including one million Illinoisans).

This is why @SenBrianSchatz and I have introduced the Debt-Free College Act, a bill that would provide federal incentives to states to help cover the costs of college for students without taking out debt.

On Twitter &amp; TV, President Trump called for comprehensive background checks &amp; for raising the age for all gun sales to 21. He even called out members of Congress for being “afraid of the NRA.” 

A few meetings later with NRA lobbyists &amp; the President walked back his tough talk.
We can't continue to let the NRA have veto power over gun policy in this nation. We are facing an epidemic of violence, with hundreds of Americans shot every day. Let’s put the safety of our kids and our neighborhoods ahead of the gun lobby’s agenda of selling more guns.
The students from Parkland have inspired students from across America to say #EnoughIsEnough. We should be listening to them, not the NRA, if we truly want to end senseless gun violence in this country. https://t.co/SfigcLLdCh

Opioid quota reform is needed so DEA can take important factors like diversion and abuse into account when setting quotas, rather than only chasing the downstream consequences of this crisis.
DEA plays an important gatekeeper role over the volume of opioids that can be produced each year. And while DEA has taken recent steps to lower opioid quotas, their ability to do so is limited.
14 billion opioid doses are put on the market each year—far more than necessary under current medical guidelines and enough for every adult American to have their own bottle of addictive painkillers.
Such increases occurred largely because current law directs DEA to only consider certain factors when setting quotas—like past sales and estimated demand—but not other factors such as the impact of such opioid production on diversion, abuse rates, or overdose deaths.
DEA approved significant increases in aggregate opioid production quotas between 1993 and 2015, including a 39-fold increase for oxycodone and a 12-fold increase for hydrocodone.
Every day, more than 100 Americans die from an opioid overdose. While we know that there are legitimate uses for opioid painkillers, we also know that these dangerous pills are being over-produced, over-prescribed, and over-dispensed.
I’ve joined @SenJohnKennedy, @SenFeinstein and @ChuckGrassley to introduce a bill that would strengthen DEA’s ability to prevent opioid abuse. The agency should be able to consider the opioid epidemic’s downstream effects when setting quota levels for opioid production each year.

The American people can now see the President’s agenda for what it is, and it’s not protecting Dreamers.
Democrats and a handful of courageous Republicans tried to free the Dreamers by paying that $25 billion ransom for Trump’s infamous border wall. But he rejected that offer.
Yesterday the Senate rejected the President’s immigration plan by a bipartisan supermajority.
Dramatically cutting the number of immigrants from African countries that he hatefully disparaged.
Fast-tracking deportations of Central American women and children fleeing gang and sexual violence.
Reducing legal immigration by more than 40 percent by barring Americans from sponsoring their parents, siblings and children as immigrants.
Let’s be honest, President Trump’s plan is to ransom these young Dreamers in exchange for his entire anti-immigrant agenda.

Dreamers are teachers, nurses, and engineers who contribute immensely to our country. 86% of Americans are behind them, and I’m one of them. Let’s do the right thing by keeping them in this country #DreamActNow.
DACA recipients are talented young people, their majors include: medicine, business, engineering, computer science. We must pass the #DreamActNow to #ProtectDreamers.

More than 19,000 Dreamers have already lost their DACA status because of the crisis President Trump created. After March 5th, one thousand will lose their status every day and be subject to deportation. The stakes couldn’t be higher to find a deal this week.

Joining @Morning_Joe soon to discuss the latest on the Dream Act in the Senate. Hope you can tune in.
The President’s immigration framework would fast-track deportations of children who come to our border fleeing war, gangs, and sexual violence. It would be unconscionable to do this to families in the midst of the world’s worst refugee crisis.
On the backs of Dreamers, the White House is attempting to radically slash legal immigration by prohibiting American citizens from reuniting with their parents, siblings, and children. This isn’t what America should stand for.
President Trump has rejected three separate offers to fund his broadly unpopular wall in exchange for the broadly popular Dream Act.
We have to end this needless delay now. I joined a bipartisan group of Senators today, urging congressional leadership to do the right thing by American families and pass a funding extension for community health centers ASAP.
Community health centers provide affordable health care to 27 million Americans, including 1.3 million Illinoisans. They're invaluable everywhere, but especially in rural communities. And yet, more than four months ago, Congress allowed funding for these health clinics to expire.

Attention: @SenMajLdr &amp; @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/DKlQ1VySmZ
Unless we pass the #DreamAct, I won’t support another short-term funding bill. Our Dreamers have waited far too long for a chance to be a part of this country’s future.
We must move forward on fixing the DACA crisis NOW. Our bipartisan deal is still the only bipartisan deal that would finally give Dreamers the future they deserve #DreamActNow.
To all Dreamers: I hear you, I see you, and I want to make sure you have a future in America. I won’t stop working until we pass the #DreamAct. https://t.co/NaNHkSnZ8W
Our bipartisan deal gives the President everything he asked for:

Border Security ✓
Family Unification ✓
Visa Lottery ✓
Dream Act ✓
 
This is what compromise is all about. Democrats and Republicans support it. Why wouldn’t Congress pass this deal?

I cannot believe that in the history of the White House, in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday. President Trump said things that were hate-filled, vile, and racist. He used those words repeatedly. https://t.co/6gHW5cLVvU

I’ve been clear from the start: I will consider reasonable border security measures to pass the #DreamActNow. $18 billion for a wall we don’t need and the American people don’t want doesn’t fall into the “reasonable” category.
The White House set this crisis in motion when it ended DACA four months ago. Now, they are using Dreamers as a bargaining chip to pass a wish-list of hardline anti-immigrant bills. That’s being unreasonable #DreamActNow.

Just in: Senate GOP rams through partisan tax bill that will hurt millions of working families across the country while the wealthiest 1% &amp; largest corporations receive nothing short of a windfall #GOPTaxScam
The bottom line is that Republicans believe we can afford to add $1.5T to the national debt when it comes to giving tax cuts to the wealthy, but we can’t afford it when it comes to helping the most vulnerable in our society. #GOPTaxScam
The real surprise here is that many of the so-called “fiscal hawks” in the Republican Party are ready to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit after complaining about our national debt for the last 8 years under President Obama. #GOPTaxScam
I’m on the Senate floor touting the #GOPTaxScam for what it is – a massive give-away to corporate special-interests, campaign donors, and the wealthiest Americans. Watch live here: https://t.co/x87BhFnet2
The nonpartisan @USCBO says that 13 million Americans will lose their health insurance &amp; insurance premium costs will go up by 10% each year if the #GOPTaxScam is signed into law.
After failing miserably to achieve one of their campaign promises to repeal the #ACA &amp; take away #healthcare from millions of families, Republicans have slipped in to the #GOPTaxScam a provision that will undermine our health care system.
Why are the GOP rushing through their partisan #GOPTaxScam? Because if the bill were to receive proper scrutiny, it would be revealed for what it is—a monumental give-away to corporate special-interests, campaign donors, and the wealthiest Americans.

We have seen far too many lives lost – in #SandyHook, in Chicago, in towns and communities across America – to stand by silently.  We must act to reduce the deadly toll of gunfire.
While mass shootings continue to occur with horrifying frequency in the U.S., the gun lobby and the Republican Congress are trying to weaken laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.  That is wrong.
And sadly, Congress has done nothing – nothing – to try to prevent another senseless tragedy like #SandyHook from happening again. Instead, last week, the GOP-controlled House of Reps. passed legislation that would weaken gun laws on the books in many states, including Illinois.
5 years ago today, 12 little girls, 8 little boys, and 6 educators were senselessly &amp; heinously murdered at #SandyHook a mere 11 days before they were supposed to celebrate the Christmas holiday w their family &amp; friends. It remains one of the darkest days of my time in Congress.

That is far too high. I'll continue to work with DEA to bring these opioid quotas down to a lower level of legitimate medical need. 
 
With over 200 million opioid prescriptions written and tens of thousands of people dying, Congress &amp; the DEA have a responsibility to act.
However, drug companies still flood the market with an estimated 14 billion opioid pills – enough for every adult in America to have a one-month prescription.
Since 2016, DEA has met with me several times &amp; worked to lower opioid quotas 2 years in a row. Aggregate production quotas are now down by an average of 41 percent from where they were in 2016 https://t.co/m3zv9fbY5e
Between 1993 &amp; 2015, DEA allowed production of oxycodone to increase 39-fold and hydrocodone to increase 12-fold.  With higher quotas, opioid prescriptions soared – from 76 million in 1991 to 245 million in 2014 – and overdose deaths quadrupled to more than 33,000 in 2015.
At today's Judiciary Committee hearing, I questioned the DEA Acting Assistant Administrator on the DEA's role in the rise of the national opioid addiction epidemic. Watch below https://t.co/speMaCe2vJ

Republican health care promises do not match reality. I urge my colleagues to actually do something for the Americans we serve and and work with us to strengthen our health care system.
Republicans promised to lower health insurance premiums.
 
Instead they’ve acted to increase premiums via repeal, sabotage, and refusing to pass bipartisan health care stabilization bills.
Republicans promised to treat the opioid epidemic like an emergency.
 
Yet there has been no emergency funding to respond to it.
Republicans promised to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. 
 
Instead, their #GOPTaxScam lowered the corporate tax rate for Big Pharma.
Health care funding for 9 million kids expired more than 2 months ago.

Instead of ramming through their tax scam, Republicans could be working to reauthorize health care for 9 million children. It’s been 2 months.

27,000 Americans have parents who are TPS recipients from Haiti. The Trump Admin is forcing parents to choose between leaving their kids behind or living in fear of deportation. Cruel.
It’s dangerous and irresponsible to force local police departments to choose between redirecting scarce policing resources to carry out the Trump/Sessions mass deportation agenda or else sacrificing critical violence prevention funds.
This decision is good news for the rule of law in America. Attorney General Sessions cannot hold hostage the federal funds our police departments count on to fight violent crime in cities like Chicago. https://t.co/NImxAIb4Jr.
This will tear families apart, damage our economy, and harm U.S. national security interests. I call on the Trump Admin to reverse this heartless decision. #SaveTPS https://t.co/rwHbcR3MaC

@ChuckGrassley @SenMikeLee @SenWhitehouse We may not always see eye to eye, but this bill will help us to uphold America’s promise of justice for all.
@ChuckGrassley @SenMikeLee @SenWhitehouse Our bill could be a significant bipartisan achievement of this Congress &amp; an important step in our nation’s ongoing quest for justice.
@ChuckGrassley @SenMikeLee @SenWhitehouse It will reduce taxpayer costs and empower law enforcement to keep dangerous criminals off our streets.
@ChuckGrassley @SenMikeLee @SenWhitehouse Nonviolent offenders who’ve done significant time will get a second chance to rejoin their families and contribute to their communities.
@ChuckGrassley @SenMikeLee @SenWhitehouse The goal of this bill is simple: To improve public safety and the rule of law by ensuring that penalties match their crime. #CJReform

I’ve been fighting for the #DreamAct and Dreamers for 16 years. I won’t stop until they are #HereToStay
.@FoxNews found that 79% of Americans support a path to citizenship for Dreamers. Answer is clear: #DreamActNow
And it would result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over 10 years.
The Cato Institute estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA recipients will cost $60 billion over the next decade.
Non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy: DACA-eligible individuals contribute $2 billion/year in state &amp; local taxes.
#Dreamers belong here — forcing them out of the only country they’ve ever known will lead to an economic and humanitarian crisis.
The Trump Administration’s deportation clock is ticking for these young people. We must pass the #DreamAct before it’s too late.
Beginning on March 5, 2018: 1,400 Dreamers will lose their work permits and be subject to deportation every work day for the next 2 years.
SOON: @LindseyGrahamSC and I will stand with 100 Dreamers to call on Congress to pass the #DreamAct. Watch here: https://t.co/buuMGZX7Hc

President Trump’s assessment that we must build a “big, beautiful wall” on the Southern border doesn’t square with reality

This includes 300,000 Illinois seniors &amp; people with disabilities. It also includes 1.5M children, or half of all kids in Illinois.

.@IHAhospitals 5.5M Illinoisans have a pre-existing condition, but with #TrumpCare, they would go back to paying sky-high premiums for inadequate care

.@IHAhospitals predicts that #TrumpCare would result in more than 55,000 job losses in Illinois alone
Next year alone, #TrumpCare would take health insurance away from 311k Illinoisans with private health plans &amp; 170k who depend on Medicaid

It would allow insurance companies to charge sky-high premiums if you or family member has history of asthma, cancer, or diabetes

Great to meet w @averycoonley students this morning visiting our nation's beautiful Capitol Building https://t.co/2CKojRbpYM
The banks’ own study shows small businesses are satisfied with debit fees under the swipe reform law. Repeal would raise those fees.
Big banks are already making record profits. No need to let them rig the debit swipe fee system again
Repealing swipe fee reform would be a gut punch to Main Street restaurants, retailers, &amp; gas stations. It would raise prices &amp; cost jobs
Now the big banks &amp; their friends in Congress want to repeal this reform, doubling the average debit swipe fee
Even though banks fought this reform every step of the way, it has boosted competition &amp; reduced debit fees
In 2010, Congress passed swipe fee reform to rein in Visa &amp; MasterCard’s debit fee-fixing on behalf of big banks
That’s a rigged system. It avoids competition and makes merchants/ consumers pay banks billions in excessive fees
For years I’ve heard big banks argue to let Visa &amp; MasterCard fix swipe fee rates on their behalf

I will vote no when Gorsuch comes before the Judiciary Cmte. I will vote no on cloture. I will oppose his nomination on the Senate floor.
With the legal and constitutional issues haunting this White House, the Senate cannot rubber stamp a lifetime appointment for this President
60 votes is a threshold that #SCOTUS nominees have met for the past ¼ century. If Gorsuch falls short, then Trump should pick a new nominee.
Majority Leader McConnell has made clear time and time again that 60 votes is the standard for matters of controversy in the Senate.
No one should be surprised that Judge Gorsuch will need to meet the threshold of 60 Senate votes in order to be confirmed.
I came away from his hearing firmly convinced that I must oppose the nomination of Judge Gorsuch.
Judge Gorsuch was given a full and fair hearing. He was given every opportunity to explain his judicial record and his views.
He needed to show that he'd be an independent check on President Trump and rule against the right-wing groups that picked him if required
Judge Gorsuch needed to be straight with the American people about his record and his views—avoiding critical questions was unacceptable
Judge Gorsuch needed to demonstrate that he would uphold and defend the Constitution for ALL of us, not just the privileged few

This #SCOTUS seat doesn't belong to Pres. Trump or the GOP. It belongs to the American people, and I’ll make sure their voices are heard.
In recent years, the Court has shifted dramatically toward big money corporate interests at the expense of American workers and small biz
The independence of our judicial system--esp. #SCOTUS—is more critical than ever. That's the context in which I'll review this nomination.
Just 12 days in, we’ve seen unlawful exec orders blocked by fed courts&amp;the unprecedented dismissal of an AG for disagreeing with Pres. Trump

Jeff Sessions is not that person, and I cannot support his nomination to Attorney General https://t.co/X92t6lXKIn
This is a constitutional moment. America’s integrity is at stake—we need an AG willing to defend our Constitution&amp; stand up for what’s right
Based on his record &amp; his responses to questions raised by this Cmte &amp; by me, I am not confident that Senator Sessions would be such an AG
.@TheJusticeDept motto — Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur — refers to an AG “who prosecutes on behalf of justice”
Where wld Sen Sessions stand on these issues if he's AG? Wld he stand up the Pres if his actions are unlawful? I think we know the answer
But it's also the duty of America’s chief law enforcement officer to stand up to the Pres when his actions do not serve interests of justice
On issue after issue, Senator Sessions has said that, as Attorney General, he would simply ‘enforce the law’
As America’s chief law enforcement officer, the AG has vast authority &amp; discretion over how the law is enforced &amp; who it is enforced against

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @nikiinthehouse. I appreciate your years of service on behalf of working families in #MA03, &amp; will miss you in the halls of Congress next year.
Today, the House will begin consideration of a bipartisan bill to reauthorize @FAANews, including a provision I advocated for that helps communities rebuild stronger following disasters. I hope it remains bipartisan &amp; GOP does not add partisan amendments. https://t.co/vaUmZik1H1

In Feb 2016, I visited Flint with @RepDanKildee, @RepLawrence, @RepDebDingell, @RepCummings, &amp; @RepScottPeters to see the crisis firsthand. It is unacceptable that these communities still lack access to clean, safe drinking water 4 years after the crisis began. #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/Vhd51xfykx
On the 4 year anniversary of the Flint water crisis, families there are still using filters &amp; bottled water. The crisis is not over &amp; Congress must do more to ensure access clean drinking water &amp; make robust investments in water infrastructure. #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/XQb0savZ4s
I also told reporters that polling from @MorningConsult/@Politico today shows opposition to the #GOPTaxScam is increasing. That’s because it gives 83% of the tax cuts to the wealthiest in America &amp; harms the fiscal stability of our country.
I said to press it is time for @SpeakerRyan to honor his commitment to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; bring DACA legislation to the Floor for a vote. Read more about how 245 Republicans &amp; Democrats have come together on an effort to consider DACA measures: https://t.co/8U9YZKuPTR

The Trump Administration’s dangerous race to eliminate as many environmental protections as possible will leave us vulnerable to ecological threats and climate change. Republicans must accept that climate change is real and that we have a responsibility to address it.

I urge Republicans to take steps back toward bipartisanship and work with Democrats to negotiate a compromise #FarmBill that does not weaken our ability to fight hunger or support farmers. #ProtectSNAP 4/4
Dems are ready to work w GOP to write a #FarmBill that meets Congress’s commitment to growers &amp; to those who consume what they produce.  Our nutrition assistance programs help keep 40 million Americans from going hungry, &amp; they remain a critical tool in our war on poverty. 3/4
American farmers are already living under the uncertainty caused by low commodity prices and the potential impact of President Trump’s reckless trade policies.  They don’t need the added anxiety of House Republicans injecting partisan politics into the #FarmBill. 2/4
Disappointed @ConawayTX11 has chosen to mark up a partisan #FarmBill that includes severe cuts to nutrition assistance for Americans in need. Moreover, it fails to invest in rural development &amp; bioenergy programs, &amp; undermines conservation efforts. https://t.co/EUsFEZt7FJ 1/4

When Americans pay their taxes as millions did on #TaxDay, they expect their tax dollars will be used to benefit the many, not just the few. The new #GOPTaxScam does the opposite by giving 83% of the benefits to the wealthiest Americans. https://t.co/g23SxRQFBp

An important reminder on #TaxDay—the #GOPTaxScam adds trillions to the deficit over the next decade &amp; puts critical domestic programs, such as nutrition assistance, on the chopping block. We must #ProtectSNAP. https://t.co/P5wooSByOt

Thank you, @RepAnthonyBrown, for highlighting the importance of taking meaningful steps to address poverty &amp; expand opportunity, instead of exploding the deficit to give tax breaks to the wealthy and slashing proven anti-poverty programs as the GOP has set out to do. https://t.co/0lJyx2ZDuh
The GOP is sticking future generations with a credit card bill in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest in America. According to the nonpartisan @USCBO, the #GOPTaxScam will explode America’s deficit by $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. #TaxDay https://t.co/4spgy890Fn https://t.co/B9Xxxwnuhp
Due to the #GOPTaxScam, the wealthiest 5% in Maryland will receive the majority of the tax breaks in our state while thousands of hardworking middle class families will be left behind. That’s unacceptable. #TaxDay https://t.co/F1jphuIeAn
Republicans promised their tax law would benefit America’s workers, but nearly 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies have not announced a plan to share their tax windfall with employees. #GOPTaxScam #TaxDay https://t.co/4spgy890Fn https://t.co/gDqgucnulb
In addition, I told reporters that while I supported Friday’s strike in response to the use of chemical weapons, if @POTUS’ airstrikes in #Syria are an ongoing effort he ought to seek an AUMF from Congress.

There are a number of outstanding priorities that Congress must address: the need to fund govt, #ProtectDREAMers, protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, pass a bipartisan farm bill, &amp; more.
When speaking with press this morning, I said #TaxDay is a reminder that the #GOPTaxScam is another broken promise from GOP &amp; @POTUS. It benefits wealthy investors &amp; large corporations at the expense of working families &amp; explodes the deficit.

Today we remember Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated 50 yrs ago on this day. He is with us in spirit, having left us a task unfinished but also giving us tools to complete it: compassion, truth, determination to strive for justice &amp; equality. https://t.co/VNaGf1geWZ #MLK50 https://t.co/rzxJS2vCT4

Everyone counts in the Census, and any effort that undermines that is not in America’s best interest. Congress ought to take steps to overturn the Trump Administration’s effort to subvert the Census. 2/2
Trump Admin’s decision to add an untested citizenship question to the #Census is an attack on immigrant communities &amp; on the integrity of the 2020 Census. This change will discourage participation &amp; undermine trust in and the accuracy of the Census. https://t.co/DYyjTSiEqh 1/2
26 retired generals &amp; admirals are calling for @RealDonaldTrump to reverse his harmful #TransBan &amp; #ProtectTransTroops. From their statement, “[the ban] deprives the military of trained and skilled service members, which harms readiness and morale.” https://t.co/XBGT2KcFs8

We must have a coordinated, strategic response to Russian aggression. I support imposing sanctions on those Russian individuals &amp; entities involved in the Salisbury attack &amp; hope Congress can work together to make clear that we will not tolerate such actions by Russia. 2/2

My heart breaks for the family and friends of Jaelynn Willey. Jaelynn deserves to be remembered for the joy and grace in which she lived her life. My prayers are with the Great Mills community as they grieve their tragic loss.
A few reminders, Mr. President:
1. You ended #DACA &amp; created this crisis.
2. You’ve rejected every bipartisan solution put forward to #ProtectDREAMers.
3. @SpeakerRyan &amp; GOP leaders won’t allow a vote on DACA legislation. https://t.co/rwSjNSZQt6

Thank you @RepStephMurphy for your leadership &amp; commitment to ensuring that the @CDCgov can research #GunViolence. It is an important step in our effort to #EndGunViolence. #NeverAgain https://t.co/N4DTPXJtBz
The consequence is a weaker America, &amp; I hope the Senate Intelligence Committee’s bipartisan efforts will provide real clarity into the extent of Russia’s attack on our democracy. 3/3
Committee Republicans did everything in their power to undermine a real inquiry. Instead, they acted as though they were POTUS’ defense team, distracting from attention on Russian interference by harping on conspiracy theories. 2/3
Shameful that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee chose to allow rank partisanship to cloud the investigation of Russia’s interference in our elections. https://t.co/NXupJPVjhk 1/3
8 years ago, the #ACA was signed into law. Since then, it has expanded coverage &amp; lowered costs. I joined Dems &amp; advocates to call on GOP to abandon their efforts to sabotage the law &amp; work with Dems to improve access to affordable, quality health care. https://t.co/mUHmaeBJ5S https://t.co/lndJt1kAFk
While I’m glad the funding bill passed by the House included provisions that will benefit #MD05, forcing such a significant bill through Congress without time to consider it is not fiscally responsible. Marylanders deserve better. https://t.co/2zis9psqJJ
The Republican leadership’s continuing inaction on DACA clearly reflects its unwillingness to resolve this crisis.  It is outrageous, and Democrats will continue to hold the Speaker to his word &amp; demand action to #protectDREAMers. 2/2
Republicans brought a 2,200-page #omnibus to the Floor in less than 24 hrs. It violates every rule they've set for themselves &amp; is not fiscally responsible. But what is more egregious is that the GOP continues to dissemble on promises to address #DACA. https://t.co/BDcx6WJJfK 1/2
Today, I asked @HouseGOP Members to join me on the Floor if they have read the 2,200+ page funding bill that they released last night &amp; we are about to vote on. Not one of them joined me. #ReadTheBill https://t.co/n2xTXZFWHn

I also said GOP leaders need to speak out and not be silent in the face of efforts by President Trump to undermine the Special Counsel’s investigation &amp; the credibility of law enforcement.
When speaking with reporters, I said I was appalled by @RealDonaldTrump’s attempt to seek favor with Putin by congratulating him on winning his sham election.
It is unacceptable that @SpeakerRyan is refusing to allow a vote to #ProtectDREAMers. GOP leaders ought to put DACA legislation on the Floor under the Queen of the Hill Rule &amp; let the House work its will.
I also told press that Republicans have had more than 6 months to get their job done and fund the government. We’ll see what they put forward, but they need to drop poison pill riders from the omnibus funding bill if they want Dem support.
I reiterated that the Congress must take action to #EndGunViolence. I agree with a MD student who said last week during the #NationalSchoolWalkout: “Their right to an assault rifle does not outweigh our right to life.” #NeverAgain
I spoke to press this afternoon &amp; reiterated my thanks to @FirstSheriff, @SMCPS_Supt, and @WaldenBH mental health professionals who worked so quickly to respond to the tragic shooting at Great Mills High School in #MD05. #WeAreGreatMills #HornetStrong

I told press this morning that lack of action on #DACA highlights the GOP's failure of leadership to solve problems important to the public. Nearly 90% of Americans believe we need to #ProtectDREAMers. GOP leaders should bring legislation to the Floor &amp; let the House vote.
When speaking with reporters today, I said @RealDonaldTrump’s ousting of #Tillerson highlights the dysfunction of the @WhiteHouse. This President creates chaos and it makes our country less safe.

Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, has an important oversight responsibility, &amp; we need to make sure that the Administration is taking every step possible to protect the integrity of our election systems &amp; hold Russia accountable for its malfeasance. 2/3

I said to press that it is absurd that House Republicans won’t allow a vote on legislation supported by 97% of the American people to ensure universal background checks for gun purchases. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain
I told press I continue to be alarmed by the Trump Administration’s weak stance on the Russia investigation. Intelligence officials have said we are not doing enough to respond to the threat posed by Russia. We must be more aggressive.
When speaking with reporters today, I said we have 11 legislative days to pass an omnibus funding bill. That is possible if @HouseGOP works with Democrats on a bipartisan bill.
I told press that @SpeakerRyan said he would not duck the tough issues. He is doing exactly the opposite by failing to bring legislation to the Floor to #protectDREAMers, which 87% of Americans support.
Today, the House will consider 9 bills, none of which address the urgent need to #ProtectDREAMers. @HouseGOP leadership has failed to bring a single bill to the Floor to address the #DACA crisis @realDonaldTrump created. It’s time to act on this issue. https://t.co/PQe0tq4D0X

This afternoon, I toured the control tower, viewed the radar system, &amp; joined a roundtable at @INDairport w @RepAndreCarson &amp; @RepBarragan to learn more about how #Indianapolis' investments in aviation infrastructure are helping the local economy &amp; creating jobs. #MakeItInAmerica https://t.co/FoZmk3Uakn
I heard time and time again today that investing in infrastructure is good for business. Local community leaders called on the federal government to remain involved in infrastructure as technology shifts. 7/7
I heard from community members doing a study on sustainability, resiliency, &amp; the city’s vulnerabilities when it comes to climate change, &amp; that Congress should look at what the country can do to prepare our infrastructure for the future rather than reacting to last disaster. 6/7
Another concern raised today in #Indy was about aging water and sewer infrastructure, a problem we see across the country. 5/7
Participants also discussed how infrastructure can help alleviate poverty so more people can #MakeItInAmerica. Improved public transit provides lower cost transit options &amp; jobs that can help Americans get out of poverty. 4/7
I heard public-private partnerships aren't a panacea. The debt from investments must be paid back, it’s not free money. 3/7
The @WhiteHouse infrastructure proposal asks for 80% of funding to come from local communities. I heard a unanimous "no" from the community when I asked if that was workable. 2/7
Today's #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour stop in #Indianapolis focused on infrastructure, which is key to creating jobs and strengthening our economic competitiveness. Here are some of my takeaways from the discussion with local leaders. 1/7
On Saturday, I toured @nrec_cmu w @USRepMikeDoyle &amp; learned about entrepreneurship &amp; robotics technology. We heard on the #ListeningTour that embracing innovation and rapidly changing technology will be key to ensuring businesses &amp; workers can #MakeItInAmerica. https://t.co/jVCERxVDzU
On the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour, I joined @RepAndreCarson &amp; @RepBarragan for a ride on the @IndyGoBus, the largest fleet of electric buses in the country. Local officials discussed how investments in new transit systems has helped create local jobs. https://t.co/Yhk01ZSh2n
Good morning from Indianapolis, our final city on this #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour. This morning I am joined by @RepAndreCarson &amp; @RepBarragan at the @IndyGoBus Center for a conversation with community leaders about infrastructure successes &amp; challenges in #Indy. https://t.co/2bcVM4jIuT
Happy birthday to my friend, Regional Whip, &amp; a committed advocate for consumer's rights on @JECDems, @RepMaloney.
Wishing a happy birthday to Ranking Member of @NRDems, @RepRaulGrijalva.
This #PresidentsDay, I join in reflecting on the service of our nation’s presidents, including John F. Kennedy whose remarks inspired me to pursue public service. https://t.co/vgzLacMFhD
With technology always changing, it’s important that workers have access to skills training throughout their careers. Roundtable participants said Congress can take steps to ensure that workers have access to continuing training so our workforce can stay competitive. 7/7
Another concern was that training for new skills is often expensive. What role can Congress play in ensuring that American workers have access to affordable skills training? One recommendation was investing in these programs instead of cutting them. 6/7
An interesting challenge brought up more than once at the education roundtable this morning is that children are presented with college as the only path post-high school. How can we change that? 5/7
In Toledo, I heard we ought to embrace technology and that we shouldn’t fear automation because American workers should build the robots that businesses will use. 4/7
Roundtable participants pointed out the best workers aren't always the best trainers. One suggestion I heard was to create partnerships between manufacturers and educators to ensure we have strong teachers who can prepare students. 3/7
Right now, there are jobs open across the United States but our workers are not trained to fill these roles. How can we close that gap? 2/7
We had a great discussion this morning during the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour in Toledo. We talked about the importance of ensuring that our workforce has the training necessary to be prepared for the jobs of the future. 1/7
On the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour this morning, I am in Toledo, OH at @trainwithcts with @RepMarcyKaptur &amp; @RepBarragan for a round table discussion on what we can do to close the skills gap &amp; ensure all workers have the skills training for the next generation of jobs. https://t.co/VRCHGr8uXu
No family should be torn apart like this, and our communities should not lose people like Jorge who are productive, law-abiding, tax-paying residents. Their story is why our nation must enact comprehensive immigration reform. I’m proud to stand with #TeamGarcia. 2/2
I had the honor of meeting the family of Jorge Garcia, who was brought here as a child &amp; lived in the U.S. for 30 yrs &amp; was deported by ICE in Jan. I spoke with his wife Cindy &amp; children Soleil &amp; Jorge &amp; it was heartbreaking to hear how this family has been split apart. 1/2 https://t.co/6PkvXcCf0V
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Vice-Ranking Member of @NRDems, @RepHuffman.
Happy birthday to my good friend, @RepEliotEngel. Thank you for your leadership as Ranking Member of @HFACDemocrats.
An important theme raised in all of our discussions about how we can help more businesses #MakeItInAmerica is mentorship. Entrepreneurs need mentors who have faced similar challenges and can help guide them. 5/5
For small business to succeed, they ought be able to export their products, which is a challenge for many small businesses. I want to see how the U.S. government can help ensure that businesses that #MakeitinAmerica can sell their products around the world. 4/5
We also discussed the importance of educating high school students about opportunities to pursue entrepreneurship. How can we help change the curriculum so students are aware of these opportunities? 3/5
In #Pittsburgh, we discussed the importance of access to quality, affordable health care for employees. 2/5
The #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour is underway &amp; I’ve heard from small business owners about barriers to success for entrepreneurs. 1/5
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a strong voice for #WA01 on @WaysMeansCmte, @RepDelBene. Thank you for your work to highlight the impact of the #GOPTaxScam on middle-class families.
Following a tour of @EICPittsburgh, I joined a roundtable hosted by @USRepMikeDoyle to hear from entrepreneurs about the challenges facing new businesses &amp; suggestions for policies to help start-ups #MakeItInAmerica. #ListeningTour https://t.co/FlQEraZLD1
Kicked off the 2nd #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour with a tour of @EICPittsburgh with @USRepMikeDoyle &amp; local business owners &amp; discussed how incubators help businesses #MakeItInAmerica through workforce development &amp; training. https://t.co/O8Ipl3HtRo
I guess that counts as checkmate. https://t.co/FUq9g24ewV
The #GOPTaxScam benefits the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class. In fact, shareholders are seeing 43 times the profit compared to America’s workers. https://t.co/uZwrLDpOr4
The American people deserve to understand the scope of Russia’s attempts to subvert our democracy. Allowing the Special Counsel to proceed unimpeded ought to be a bipartisan priority. Retweet if you agree. https://t.co/Ry5zgBZXVH
No longer can POTUS pretend that Putin’s Russia was not responsible for cyberattacks targeting the 2016 election. Today’s indictments are another example of why the Mueller investigation must continue unimpeded. The American people need to learn the truth. https://t.co/mYwE4p4jR4
Read today’s @RollCall piece on my 2nd #MakeitinAmerica #ListeningTour, this time to the Industrial Heartland. I’ll be hearing from Americans in Pittsburgh, Toledo &amp; Indianapolis about economic challenges &amp; econ initiatives in their communities that work. https://t.co/ZgZJiLc7kh

Pleased to join my friend @RepWilson &amp; the Congressional Members of #AlphaKappaAlpha at their reception in support of the Commemorative Stamp to honor Ethel Hedgeman Lyle. #SheDeservesAStamp https://t.co/JUgJe1713l
Follow along on the trip using the hashtags #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour. I look forward to hearing from our fellow citizens about economic pressures they face, initiatives that work, &amp; challenges that need to be addressed.
Many Americans believe that Congress is ignoring the economic insecurity they feel. The #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour tries to do things differently by getting out of Washington to listen to what they have to say in order to develop policies that address their concerns.
Following our successful #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour in November, I’m pleased to announce I’ll be traveling across the Industrial Heartland to Pittsburgh, Toledo, &amp; Indianapolis on the next round of the Listening Tour. https://t.co/UiGLz369MU
Wishing a happy birthday to @RepKathleenRice. Thank you for your commitment to national security &amp; leadership as Ranking Member on @HomelandDems’ Subcommittee on Counterterrorism &amp; Intelligence.
I am grateful to @BettyMcCollum04, @RepDonBeyer, @RepHuffman, @RepMcNerney, &amp; @RepJimmyGomez for speaking out today in opposition to President Trump’s #DirtyBudget. Dems are committed to protecting public health &amp; our environment from harmful budget cuts.
I reject the false choice presented in @realDonaldTrump’s #InfrastructureScam, which undermines public health &amp; environmental protections. America does not need to choose between building new infrastructure &amp; protecting the environment. We can, &amp; must, do both.
The #DirtyBudget released by the Trump Administration cuts 90% of the successful Chesapeake Bay Program at @EPA, harming Maryland’s public health, environment, &amp; economy and undermining efforts to #SaveTheBay. https://t.co/wbzULHcusF
The Administration’s #DirtyBudget eliminates thousands of @EPA positions on the front lines of the fight to safeguard our children &amp; grandchildren from harmful pollutants &amp; toxic substances.
It is unacceptable that President Trump’s #DirtyBudget cuts @EPA programs that help keep arsenic, lead, and mercury out of our drinking water &amp; air.  RT if you oppose @RealDonaldTrump’s #DirtyBudget https://t.co/4uHlTqICI7
Today, I join in urging Congressional Republicans to reject President Trump’s #DirtyBudget. This extreme budget undermines public health and our environment by slashing funding that helps keep our air and water clean &amp; preserve natural resources for future generations.
We have just four legislative days to #ProtectDREAMers.

It is time for @SpeakerRyan to let the people’s House work its will. He should put the immigration bills pending in this House on the Floor and let the majority rule. Retweet if you agree. https://t.co/SXk0ckz61a
Read this important thread from my friend @SenDuckworth on why we must #StopHR620. I urge my colleagues in the House to vote no &amp; defeat this bill. #DisabilityRightsAreCivilRights #HandsOffMyADA https://t.co/1UtfO3Ryiu
H.R. 620 is a harmful bill that guts the Americans with Disabilities Act and must be defeated in the House. In the name of upholding the bedrock principles of civil rights law in this country and the integrity of the #ADA, we must #StopHR620. https://t.co/rAQx6Qj0Xg
Today, the House will consider a bill that guts the American with Disabilities Act. This bill this would be the first time Congress weakened an existing civil rights law, in this way, through subsequent legislation. I urge my colleagues to #StopHR620. https://t.co/57iMzrt7LM

@RepSarbanes @House_DRTF .@House_DRTF’s report on the #GOPTaxScam is alarming. Republicans added trillions to the debt to cut taxes for their wealthy donors. Thank you @RepSarbanes for your work to show the American people that the GOP is siding w the top 1% over the middle class. https://t.co/kHC2hLGvOQ
The Broward County law enforcement &amp; first responders securing the scene &amp; treating victims deserve great praise for their courage &amp; professionalism.  I will be praying for the victims &amp; their families to have the strength to face the difficult days &amp; weeks ahead. 4/4
There should never be a wrong place, especially when that place is a school.  And there is never a wrong time for us to do what is right and tackle this challenge head-on. 3/4
For how much longer must students, teachers, movie-goers, travelers, workers, public servants, concert-attendees, worshippers, and Americans of every kind have to live in fear of suddenly being in the wrong place at the wrong time? 2/4
I was again shocked &amp; saddened to see an American school subjected to the horrors of gun violence today.  How long before our nation comes together to address this crisis responsibly? #StonemanShooting https://t.co/Ymjp90cZ6L 1/4

In light of testimony yesterday that Russia intends to target the 2018 midterm elections, it is imperative Congress take steps to protect our democracy.  The report released by the Election Security Task Force will help address this threat: https://t.co/cROoln31bh
I am heartbroken by the #StonemanShooting &amp; I continue to monitor reports. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with the people of Broward County as well as law enforcement &amp; first responders on the scene. Our nation must take action to address gun violence.
On #ValentinesDay, it’s hard not to think of the most faithful relationship of all: GOP leaders &amp; their wealthy donors, especially after Republicans added $1.5 trillion to the deficit to give them enormous tax breaks. https://t.co/7jbbN6eXnf https://t.co/vKDyBLkKFu
For months, @OversightDems Ranking Member @RepCummings has been sounding the alarm about this problem, and I am glad that Committee Republicans are finally willing to investigate. https://t.co/fPBcmJkVZg
It is fitting that @GOPoversight should investigate whether @WhiteHouse personnel were improperly accessing classified materials while holding only interim security clearances. I hope this investigation is serious and bipartisan. https://t.co/tSBj5PL542

I also told press that Democrats continue to stand with the 86% of Americans who want to see a permanent, legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers. Hopefully the Congress will accomplish that in the coming days.
I announced today that I will continue my #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour this weekend. I will visit Pittsburgh, Toledo, &amp; Indianapolis to hear directly from middle-class Americans about the economic challenges they face &amp; how Congress can ensure they can make it in America.
The @WhiteHouse infrastructure “proposal” is a fantasy &amp; assumes state &amp; local governments will bear the burden of modernizing our nation’s infrastructure. I told reporters it is another pie-in-the-sky proposal from @RealDonaldTrump.
Today when speaking with press, I said @RealDonaldTrump’s #TrumpBudget is none of the things he claims. It is inefficient, ineffective, irresponsible, &amp; irrelevant. It represents another broken promise to balance the budget – instead it explodes the deficit.
I’m deeply troubled the House is taking up H.R. 620, which undermines the Americans with Disabilities Act. I urge @SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOPLeader not to bring this bill to the Floor &amp; will join with disability &amp; civil rights advocates in fiercely opposing it. https://t.co/kbxRiCpHZ5

The #TrumpBudget doesn’t come close to balancing as a result of the #GOPTaxScam.

.@RealDonaldTrump, @MickMulvaneyOMB—fixed your budget title for you. 
 
Budgets reflect priorities, &amp; this is a clear statement that this POTUS doesn’t prioritize fiscal sustainability; middle class workers &amp; their families; or investments in our economy. https://t.co/8pjxbAnwgc https://t.co/DC05cmZyaR
New report that the Trump Admin is seeking to keep the @FBI HQ in downtown DC is extremely alarming. Congress must reject this reckless proposal and look into why the Administration would make such a careless decision. https://t.co/KNgyxXU0qG
.@WhiteHouse infrastructure plan is not a serious plan to fix crumbling roads, bridges, airports, seaports, rail networks or to build 21st century infrastructure we need to grow the economy. I hope Congress can seek a better alternative. https://t.co/FgGfsAcsOs

A Republican Senator has held up passage of the bipartisan budget agreement all day. The Republican-led House is now waiting for votes between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. This is yet another example of Republicans’ inability to govern effectively.
With only hours to act &amp; avoid another #TrumpShutdown, I urge @SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOPLeader to bring to the Floor a one-day funding bill to keep the government open. Dems do not want to see govt shut down &amp; are prepared to vote for a one-day measure. https://t.co/zPiwCVqZfs

Today, when speaking with reporters, I held up a dollar and 50 cents &amp; discussed how out of touch it is for @SpeakerRyan to brag about that when the 1% will receive $1,191 a week. It’s another demonstration of the skewed priorities of the GOP.

There is still more work that needs to be done. The Trump Admin has been undermining workers' rights since coming into office &amp; has done nothing to extend paid family &amp; medical leave or help families afford child care. I hope Dems &amp; the GOP will work together to change that. 2/2

Chairman Nunes’s facilitation of this release and his altering of the memo was shameful and inappropriate.  That’s why I’ve urged the Speaker to #RemoveNunes. Congress must protect the Special Counsel’s investigation so that it can move forward unimpeded &amp; get to the truth. 2/2
POTUS chose to ignore the warnings from DOJ, FBI, &amp; intel community to release #NunesMemo to smear the law enforcement agencies investigating his campaign. Nobody has any doubts regarding what this is all about: undermining the Russia investigation.  https://t.co/raHAeSG7YE 1/2
I enjoyed meeting Ray Stanford yesterday &amp; learning more about the fossilized dinosaur and mammal tracks he unearthed at @NASAGoddard. This exciting discovery gives further insight into life in MD over 110 million years ago. https://t.co/kcTlPWm1oG https://t.co/p6UqNRT4vk
Democrats remain focused on helping middle class get ahead.  While the GOP wastes their time pushing extreme partisan policies that put their wealthy donors first, Democrats will continue fighting for better wages, better benefits, and a better deal for working families. 2/2
Today’s #jobsreport shows that the work done during the Obama Admin to help the private sector grow jobs continues, if more slowly, under President Trump. But at a time when wages should be growing, this report shows weekly earnings fell in January. https://t.co/uSlmuR4tIs 1/2
I urge @SpeakerRyan to #RemoveNunes as Chair of the House Intel Cmte. Altering a classified memo after the Cmte’s vote is dishonest, violates House Rules, &amp; demonstrates the lengths he is willing to go undermine the rule of law in order to protect POTUS. https://t.co/tYbjX1LgeT

House Dem leadership responded to the #SOTU today. While @RealDonaldTrump tried to put a fresh coat of paint on a failing presidency, Americans see through the rhetoric &amp; understand reality. He has made our country less safe, strong, &amp; proud. https://t.co/kvJBEjeUpJ https://t.co/XYSdYNMi4j

I joined @SquawkCNBC this morning to discuss the #SOTU address. The President appealed to his partisan base, instead of reaching across the aisle, and made a number of false claims while taking credit for President Obama’s economic successes. https://t.co/8feaisreCA
Tune in to @SquawkCNBC — I’m joining the show in a few minutes to discuss President Trump’s #SOTU address.
America perseveres not because of this President but in spite of the damage he is doing to our economy, national security, &amp; democratic norms. Dems will continue fighting for all Americans &amp; to make our union safer, stronger, &amp; prouder, not in rhetoric but in reality. #SOTU 2/2
.@POTUS spoke of building a “safe, strong, &amp; proud America” in his #SOTU but neither his words nor his actions over the past year are accomplishing any of those goals. He has made Americans less safe, less strong, &amp; less proud. 1/2 https://t.co/QiFAdIzgL6

I joined @TeamCavuto today to discuss @RealDonaldTrump’s #SOTU tonight. While the President may tout the #GOPTaxScam in his address, the law adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. https://t.co/d0TpaIEB46
The House just voted a 3rd time on a defense funding bill.  Instead, we should be working toward a budget agreement that responsibly funds defense &amp; non-defense priorities &amp; adheres to the principle of parity, as we’ve agreed to do for the past four years. https://t.co/85Ah6HZ86t
.@RealDonaldTrump’s  first year in office was marked by chaos and dysfunction.

It is shameful &amp; wrong that Rep. Gosar believes that #DREAMers invited by Members to #SOTU should be detained at the doors to the Capitol – this temple to liberty and common dreams. This is not who we are. https://t.co/qT69HXQj7Z
If Republicans want to show the American people they aren’t engaging in a partisan witch hunt or blatantly seeking to protect the President by discrediting our national security agencies, they ought to allow Democrats’ memo to be released as well. 3/3
Russia’s attempts to subvert our democracy ought not to be a political game but rather an urgent bipartisan priority. 2/3
Yesterday, @CIA Director Pompeo said Russia will likely try to interfere in the 2018 elections. Instead of taking this threat to our democracy seriously, GOP is demonizing the @FBI &amp; sharing classified info that will put our national security at risk, all to protect @POTUS. 1/3
I was deeply moved by the @WashingtonPost’s tribute to my former senior policy adviser, Ed Lorenzen. The American people were greatly benefited by his service, his knowledge, and his commitment to sound fiscal policy. He will be missed. https://t.co/geKIr3xMAW
Today on the Floor, the House will consider the @DeptofDefense appropriations bill for a 3rd time, wasting time when we have only three legislative days before the current funding bill expires. https://t.co/jvu7wdGlSP
I told reporters that Democrats have a simple request for @SpeakerRyan: agree to the same policy of parity you have agreed to the last four years—nothing more, nothing less. Our nation’s security is dependent on funding both defense &amp; non-defense priorities.
My guest at tonight’s #SOTU address is my constituent &amp; #DREAMer Gabriela Hernandez. She aspires to be a social worker, which will directly benefit our community. I told reporters I am hopeful we can move ahead with legislation to #ProtectDREAMers.
I told press today that I expect the President will discuss the #GOPTaxScam in the #SOTU, but it is a credit card bill for the next generation who will be forced to pay for the trillions in tax cuts for the wealthiest in America.
When speaking with press today, I said one year after @RealDonaldTrump took office, the nation is not safer, not stronger, and many of us are not proud of the policies pursued. #SOTU

As a co-author of the legislation authorizing sanctions against #Russia for its malfeasant actions, I’m disappointed the Admin chose not to make any public pronouncement on sanctions or put forward a concrete plan to deter further Russian aggression. https://t.co/n9g3ZYfZAl
Chairman Nunes himself said in 2016 that, “those who receive classified intelligence should not barter in it – that is reckless behavior with our nation's secrets.”  I would encourage him and his Republican colleagues on the Committee to heed that same advice today. 3/3
Such a reckless and spiteful action against our national security agencies and the FBI, in particular, would provide our enemies with insight into some of our most sensitive sources and methods for intelligence gathering, putting our national security at risk.  2/3
It’s outrageous that GOP on Intel Cmte would blatantly politicize the Russia investigation by releasing a partisan memo about the @FBI. It advances the latest conspiracy theory by GOP defenders of @POTUS, using classified material to defame the FBI. https://t.co/lnaqcKRmo0 1/3

The Republican majority controls the House, Senate &amp; @WhiteHouse. They failed to fund the government, causing the #TrumpShutdown.

.@HouseGOP ought to work with Dems to adhere to the principle of parity for the 2018 budget deal. Take a look at what House GOP are putting at risk by not being willing to work with Dems to responsibly fund our nation’s defense &amp; non-defense priorities: https://t.co/5ztO8Et8vu https://t.co/9HKxOjrzRc
4 months into the fiscal yr, GOP still has not worked w Dems to reach agreement to raise spending caps &amp; fund govt. Parity between defense &amp; non-defense priorities has been a hallmark of every budget agreement since 2011. Why we should adhere to it now: https://t.co/5ztO8Et8vu https://t.co/ghkQJm6CqY
We are 4 months into the fiscal year &amp; GOP is bringing their 4th short-term funding bill to the Floor. Americans are right to be frustrated by the inability of GOP to do its job. @HouseGOP should come to the table &amp; work with Democrats to responsibly fund our nation’s priorities. https://t.co/WAISVNGOdI
Joined @JakeTapper on @TheLeadCNN to discuss Republicans’ inability to govern and address a number of priorities, including responsibly funding government, reauthorizing health programs, taking action to #protectDREAMers, and providing disaster relief. https://t.co/OqaZUZkZEh
Proud to co-sponsor the #CensureResolution introduced today by @RepRichmond &amp; @RepJerryNadler to censure @realDonaldTrump for the racist comments he made at a meeting on immigration. These comments are disgraceful &amp; damaging to our standing in the world. https://t.co/PA49aArb7y

Tune in: I’m joining @jaketapper on @TheLeadCNN around 4:15 today to discuss the need to responsibly fund the government &amp; find a legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers
.@HouseGOP spent the last 3 months of 2017 ignoring priorities of the American people to jam #GOPTaxScam through Congress.

I also told press today that Democrats will not be held hostage to bad policies &amp; inaction on legislation by Republicans. They have majorities in the House, Senate, White House &amp; are responsible for keeping the government open.
On Friday, I held a #GOPTaxScam town hall with @RepAnthonyBrown &amp; @ChrisVanHollen &amp; and the sentiment from Marylanders is that this bill will not be helpful to the middle class. I told reporters Republicans will rue the day they voted for this bill.
I also told reporters that we must take action this week to #ProtectDREAMers. Everyone agrees we should ensure DREAMers can stay here. We must reach agreement this week.
When speaking with reporters today, I said GOP is looking to kick the can down the road again with another short-term bill to fund govt. We must agree on a budget deal that adheres to parity as we always have.
It is deeply disappointing to see the uninsured rate jump by over 3 million people in 2017. @POTUS &amp; Congressional GOP took every step possible to sabotage the #ACA, driving consumers away &amp; leading insurers to reduce coverage options in the marketplaces. https://t.co/VKanwLs2wM

.@SpeakerRyan said “nobody knows” if the #GOPTaxScam will pay for itself. 

Every outside &amp; inside analysis says it won’t. @JCTGov, @TaxPolicyCenter, @USTreasury, @TaxFoundation, @Penn @Wharton, &amp; the American people. All of them know that it won’t. Not even close. https://t.co/q09HQCYoVb
Will the sun come up tomorrow?
Will Trump ever tweet again?
Will these tax cuts add to the debt?
#nobodyknows https://t.co/fxyHmiPcq2
Right now the #GOPTaxScam is just a bill stuck on Capitol Hill—and has to be voted on again because Republicans jammed it through the Congress &amp; aspects of the bill failed to comply with Senate rules. https://t.co/JvQSv0T1GV
I joined House Democrats from 18 of the 21 states targeted by Russian hackers in 2016 to call on @SpeakerRyan to take immediate action to protect state voting systems from cyberattacks and to bolster state election infrastructure. Read our letter here: https://t.co/pcYdqcddW2
The #GOPTaxScam will raise taxes on thousands of hardworking, middle-class families in Maryland while cutting taxes for the wealthiest. This bill isn’t fiscally responsible &amp; will have long-term economic consequences for our state. https://t.co/uoxci3FE47
I joined @BretBaier to discuss the #GOPTaxScam tonight. While Democrats support real, bipartisan tax reform, this bill raises taxes on 85 million middle-class families, gives massive tax cuts to the wealthy, &amp; leaves our children with the bill. https://t.co/Eq7oLpJQon

I spoke on the Floor today &amp; urged @HouseGOP to reject the #GOPTaxScam. They are pursuing a reckless and irresponsible path of raising taxes on 86 million middle-class families. Instead, they should work with Democrats on a bill that brings tax relief to the middle class. https://t.co/wj6DTMYpMV
As we near the end of the first session of the 115th Congress, it’s clear @HouseGOP continues to break their own promises of openness &amp; transparency with a record number of closed rules stifling debate and amendments.
I’ve heard @HouseGOP is seeking to shut down House Intel’s Russia investigation- I told press today Democrats will do everything we can to protect the rule of law &amp; get to the bottom of Russia’s attempts to subvert our democracy.
I told members of the press today that a number of priorities must be addressed before the end of the year. I am encouraging my Democratic colleagues to vote against a GOP bill that continues to kick the can down the road, instead of responsibly funding the entire government.
When speaking with reporters today, I said Republicans have rushed their #GOPTaxScam bill because they are terrified the bill will be disclosed for what it is—a tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.

If this President is in any way serious about national security, he should start by embracing the basic tenets of American leadership: uniting rather than dividing, &amp; defending our democratic ideals abroad and at home. 3/3

News that the death toll from Hurricane Maria in #PuertoRico has reached at least 1,065 is deeply saddening &amp; alarming. #OurFellowAmericans continue to face serious, life-threatening hardships after the storm.  https://t.co/AZSKIESl3o 1/2
Horrified by the news of @UN peacekeepers killed in action in the DRC. These brave men &amp; women &amp; their families are in my thoughts &amp; prayers. I will continue to advocate in Congress for the safety &amp; security of those seeking to promote peace in the region.
There was fiscal cliff &amp; the cromnibus… now we’re facing another legislative mess w Republicans still not having a plan to fund govt, reauthorize #CHIP, pass #DREAMAct, or address a number of other priorities. 

So, what do we call this? Submit your ideas &amp; I’ll RT my favorites.

There is no evidence that #GOPTaxScam will pay for itself. Republicans are already using the worsening deficits they’re creating to rationalize cuts to Medicare and Social Security.
I told press today that the #GOPTaxScam was passed in the worst fashion of any bill I’ve ever seen. If Democrats attempted to pass this bill through the Congress, @HouseGOP would be a 10.0 out of 9.0 on the Richter scale in outrage.

Today on the Floor, the House will vote on a resolution requiring each Member, officer, &amp; employee of the House to complete a program of training in workplace rights &amp; responsibilities each session of each Congress. https://t.co/2ohInKb8Cf
Who wins under the #GOPTaxScam? 
-Wealthy Americans
-Corporations
 
Who loses? 
-Teachers
-Seniors
-Veterans
-Students
-People w/ disabilities &amp; chronic illnesses https://t.co/gf80GE7Ig5
Republicans are jamming their #GOPTaxScam through the Congress without hearings or public input. Take a look at the dramatic difference between this partisan process &amp; real, bipartisan tax reform in 1986: https://t.co/TdZAQOyMbk
Tune in: I am joining @mitchellreports around 12:15 p.m. ET on @MSNBC.
Yesterday, @BudgetGOP passed the #GOPTaxScam that cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans and raises taxes on middle-class households. Retweet if you oppose this scam on hardworking families. https://t.co/98zyumEprF
Republicans are once again attempting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act with their #GOPTaxScam, kicking millions of Americans off their coverage. https://t.co/2wWapLgyAS
Republicans are voting to raise taxes on 82 million middle-class households. Retweet to tell @SenateGOP to reject this bill &amp; work with Democrats on real, bipartisan tax reform. https://t.co/kuNNoNZ7vR
Have you enrolled in health insurance for 2018 yet? Open enrollment ends in just over two weeks. Visit https://t.co/fms3GtodjV now &amp; #GetCovered today. https://t.co/2UZhXyebWI
Thank you to my friends @RepSandyLevin and @RepJohnLarson for joining me on the House Floor to discuss the harmful impact of the #GOPTaxScam on middle-class families.
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose the #GOPTaxScam. I hope they will do the right thing and reject this bill.
The #GOPTaxScam cannot be called bipartisan. The last time we rewrote our tax code was truly bipartisan, permanent tax reform. We did it together &amp; in a way that was paid for. https://t.co/jNzfOCj4AS
The #GOPTaxScam is not a tax cut and it’s not a jobs plan. The bill would add $1.7 trillion in added debt, meaning it would cost taxpayers $1.9 million for each job the GOP claims it would create. https://t.co/iuAuRJJlU6
On top of that, the Senate #GOPTaxScam would kick 13 million Americans off of their insurance coverage, putting further strain on our economy. https://t.co/53vEYvyGUi
Somehow, the Senate GOP achieved a worse plan for middle-class households – increasing taxes on 82 million middle-class families. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/FsM0fT2pC9
Under the House #GOPTaxScam, the wealthiest earners would see an average tax cut of $1,198 every week—52x what a middle class family would make in a year. https://t.co/K8ikAaOvlH
.@SpeakerRyan claimed a family of 4 making $59k would get a tax cut in the first yr–but their cut would shrink every year &amp; become a tax ↑. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/n1DIwdi7Xv
Happening now: I am on the House Floor discussing how the #GOPTaxScam will raise taxes on middle-class families &amp; explode the deficit while giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy. My staff will live tweet throughout.  https://t.co/bxr3IHpgFh
In the past 25 years, I’ve served with many outstanding patriots &amp; public servants, but few have matched the intellect, passion for service, &amp; tireless determination of @RepGutierrez. I wish him and his family all the best as he prepares to retire. https://t.co/GpLFvuBP3l
Today, @BudgetGOP voted to raise taxes on 82 million middle-class households &amp; force our nation deeper into debt while giving away tax cuts to the wealthiest. I urge Senate Republicans to reject the #GOPTaxScam when it comes to the Floor. https://t.co/dcgF6u7cyO
Congress must pass the #DREAMAct to #ProtectDREAMers, who are contributing to our economy &amp; national security as:  
-          Entrepreneurs
-          Teachers &amp; students
-          Doctors
-          Military service members
Learn more: https://t.co/A49h4M34CI
The House is scheduled to be in session 11 more days, but @HouseGOP still does not have a plan to keep the government open, #ProtectDREAMers, reauthorize #CHIP, or address other time-sensitive issues: https://t.co/VS1DV1FalL
Thank you @RepCummings for holding a critically important @OversightDems hearing in Maryland on the #OpioidCrisis. This national emergency affects thousands of families in #MD05 &amp; we must continue to work address this epidemic. https://t.co/KBVyuqfDqN
This week, the @SenateGOP is attempting to jam their #GOPTaxScam through, which is even worse than the House version. It cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans while raising taxes on even more middle-class households. https://t.co/3tBXTvDCPe https://t.co/z5z6XxlGLS
@Surgeon_General @CSMHeadlines I appreciated the frank discussion about ways we must work together – on a national, state, and local level – to help those struggling with addiction. I join in thanking @Surgeon_General for his commitment to this issue. 2/2

Months ago, @SenateMajLdr said tax reform must be revenue neutral. I told press today that no Republican Senator believes their #GOPTaxScam will pay for itself, even with dynamic scoring. It will explode the deficit.
When speaking with press this morning, I said the Senate #GOPTaxScam is more about politics than policy. It would raise taxes on 82 million middle-class households while giving the majority of  tax benefits to the top 1%

The #DREAMAct already has bipartisan support. Now is the time for all those who want to support #DREAMers to sign this petition.
The #DREAMAct would allow young people to help contribute to a stronger America—lending their talents to innovating &amp; creating jobs
The #DREAMAct would remove the fear of deportation for young #DREAMers.
In many cases, the U.S. is the only home that #DREAMers have known.
It is up to Congress to prevent these families from being split apart and #ProtectDREAMers from being sent to countries of their birth

GOP’s actions add to deficit &amp; risk ballooning our debt. Military leaders have said this puts our long-term national security in danger.
In their budget @HouseGOP embraces dangerous sequester, yet they disregard &amp; blow through budget caps on the defense side.

If you are 40 years old and making $11,400/year, you could pay nearly half that - $5,500 - for health care under #TrumpCare #PayMoreForLess
What does #TrumpCare mean for low-income Americans? @USCBO says premiums &amp; deductibles could reach nearly 50% of annual income.
#TrumpCare would be devastating for Marylanders – more than 207,000 would lose private insurance &amp; average premiums would increase $742 https://t.co/e9wbPLNoHE

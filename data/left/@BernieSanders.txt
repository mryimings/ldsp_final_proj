No one, including Clinton, should ever face meddling from foreign government https://t.co/bMKOAGVQAw
The findings of Robert Mueller's investigation must be taken seriously at every level of government, and he must be allowed to investigate without any interference from the White House or Congress.
Mueller's indictment provides further evidence that the Russian government interfered in 2016. It also shows that they tried to turn my supporters against Hillary Clinton in the primary and general election. I unequivocally condemn such interference.
The key issues now are: 

1) How we prevent the unwitting manipulation of our electoral and political system by foreign governments.
2) Exposing who was actively consorting with the Russian government‚Äôs attack on our democracy.
As someone who campaigned hard for Hillary Clinton from one end of this country to another, it is an outrage that she had to run against not only Donald Trump but also the Russian government.
What the Russians did in the 2016 election cycle deserves unconditional condemnation. That includes all of their conduct - whether it was active support of any candidate or active opposition to any candidate.

It is absolutely imperative that the Mueller investigation be allowed to go forward without obstruction from the Trump administration or Congress.
It has been clear to everyone (except Donald Trump) that Russia was deeply involved in the 2016 election and intends to be involved in 2018. It is the American people who should be deciding the political future of our country, not Mr. Putin and the Russian oligarchs.

A great nation is not judged its number of billionaires or the tax breaks they get. It's judged by how we treat the most vulnerable.
When workers in West Virginia have two or three jobs to stay alive, you don‚Äôt take away their health care to give billionaires tax breaks.
West Virginia‚Äôs overdose death rate is the highest in the U.S. We need more funding to address the crisis‚Äînot nearly $800B in Medicaid cuts.
What kind of country are we when anyone could think about cutting help to disabled kids in order to give tax breaks to billionaires?
This legislation is fatally flawed. No small tweak here or there will undo the massive damage it will cause to West Virginia and the nation.
How can you draft a bill of such enormous magnitude without one public comment from experts who are most knowledgeable about health care?
@SenCapito: In America we‚Äôre not supposed to take from the most vulnerable people in order to give massive tax breaks to billionaires.

This is no time for despair or giving up. This is a time for organizing, educating and fighting back.
The struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. It must be fought by every generation.
Obamacare isn‚Äôt perfect. But the solution is not to throw millions off health care without a replacement plan and say, ‚ÄúYou're on your own."
When Trump and his friends make delusional statements about "voter fraud," they are setting the stage for an increase in voter suppression.
Our job today: strengthen Obamacare and stop the repeal. Tomorrow, we must join the rest of the world and guarantee health care for all.

There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
While we attack grotesque levels of income inequality in this country, we must simultaneously address the structural racism so many endure.
When folks stand together against a rigged system, they can forge a politics that can transform a city, a nation, and maybe the world.
We cannot stay silent and watch the GOP dismantle the health care system and jeopardize the economic security of millions of Americans.
Some politicians still refuse to recognize the reality of climate change. It's 2017. That's a disgrace.
It's simple, really: Politicians should be working for their constituents' votes, not lobbyists' money. That's not radical. It's democracy.
Are we comfortable as a nation to see a huge increase in millionaires and billionaires but have more people living in poverty than ever?
After all the progress we've made on women‚Äôs rights, we can't go back to the days when women didn't have the right to control their bodies.
The right wing in this country is waging a war against women, but let me be very clear: This is not a war we are going to allow them to win.
New tax breaks for the rich and big corporations may be popular in country clubs, but it's way out of touch with what most Americans want.
We must join every other major country &amp; guarantee health care for all, not throw millions of women off excellent health care. #StandWithPP

Our message to Mr. Trump is simple: We are not going backwards. You will not divide us up by race, nationality, gender or sexual orientation
In the year 2017, we should be encouraging our people to get the best education they can, not punishing them with a mountain of debt.
If we are serious about having the best-educated workforce in the world, we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
It is unconscionable that millions of people in the world‚Äôs richest country are one diagnosis or car accident away from financial disaster.
We will lose our fights for justice when we are divided or apathetic, and the fights coming this year are far too important to risk that.
RT @maddow: Back on the air tonight after a little holiday break -- big live interview tonight with Senator @BernieSanders 9PM ET, MSNBC
Congress has got to protect and expand the health care needs of working families, not cut them.
Stopping the Republican assault on the working class will require the active participation of millions of Americans in every community.
The struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. It must be fought by every generation.
We won‚Äôt let Republicans punish the elderly, children, sick and poor while they reward their billionaire friends. https://t.co/aBgGnSd3ao
We've seen the surefire route to success in politics has been to manipulate people's fear and ignorance. We can and will change that.
We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.
Working people are angry and they have a right to be angry. This economy isn‚Äôt for them‚Äîit‚Äôs for the extremely wealthy.
Republicans are not going to get away with punishing the poor while rewarding their billionaire friends.
When we fight we‚Äôre fighting for the future‚Äîthe future of the planet in terms of climate change, and for the future of American democracy.
Happy New Year! Never forget greed is powerful but our vision of a world based on economic, social &amp; environmental justice is more powerful.
Fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. That is just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible.
The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the country. That should not be the case when people‚Äôs lives are at stake.
Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 30 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.
Cities and towns and states have stepped up and raised the minimum wage to $15. It‚Äôs about time that Congress does the same for all workers.
You cannot be a party which takes money from Wall Street and then tells working families you are on their side. People see through that.
The U.S. shouldn‚Äôt discourage kids who want to go to college with massive costs. We should be educating as many people as we possibly can.
Our goal must be to improve the VA, not destroy it. We will vigorously oppose any and all efforts to privatize the VA.
While other nations are guaranteeing health care as a right, we spend more on our military than the next seven nations combined.
I wish elected officials would spend less time making it harder for people to vote and more time fighting for the working class.
Members of Congress spend way too much time in pursuit of money and too little time actually debating the issues.
Here's a radical idea.  Let's create an economy that works for the bottom 99%, not just the people on top.
My nightmare is our grandchildren wondering why we did not leave them a planet that is habitable.
25 states and cities raised minimum wages this year. How is that possible? Because millions of people stood up to fight.
It doesn't make sense to trust billionaires to fight for the working class. The billionaire agenda is not the agenda of the American people.
If we claim to be the greatest nation on Earth, then we've got to catch up to other major countries and guarantee health care for all.
The EPA needs a leader who will actually protect the environment, not a climate denier like Trump's choice Scott Pruitt.

We have accomplished too much as a country to see our progress washed away by leaders who are fearful, hateful and misinformed.
It really is frightening when you have a party controlling the House, Senate and presidency and saying "You know what? We reject science."
One of the most revolting aspects of the student loan crisis is that the government makes billions in profits off of student loans.
A $15 minimum wage was very recently considered too radical. But when people see the justice of an idea, it catches fire very quickly.
It's an international embarrassment that we imprison more people than any other country on earth.
People should not have to choose between medicine and groceries. And yet the greed of the drug industry makes that happen every day.
People who want to limit carbon emissions:

Our priority now is to transform our energy system to renewables, not empower fossil fuel CEOs like Mr. Trump is doing.
People are frustrated because in the last few decades, the wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely while the middle class is stuck. https://t.co/dUqdaeNtpS
Trump's cabinet, the wealthiest in history, is worth more than the annual GDP of 70 countries. So much for draining the swamp...
Mr. Trump and his friends should know there are millions of people who will not stand for their greed at the expense of the working class.
While tens of millions of children around the world go hungry and uneducated, a handful of billionaires divide up the riches of the planet.
Democrats must start playing ball in states that we have conceded decades ago, where people are now being left out of the political process.
The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies, not politicians.
For decades, Republicans and Democrats have understood that the goal must be to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, not expand them.
We must stand with our brothers and sisters in NC who despite the GOP power grab are bravely fighting for economic, racial &amp; social justice.
My parents' dream was that if they worked hard as parents, they'd see their kids go to college. We must keep that promise to every family.
It's a miracle a nuclear weapon hasn't been used in war since 1945. Congress can't allow the Tweeter in Chief to start a nuclear arms race. https://t.co/7XODzlFaAG
Are we comfortable to see a huge increase in millionaires and billionaires but have more people living in poverty than ever? I know I'm not.
The ruling class likes to believe this country belongs to them. There are millions of us who would say otherwise.

If we want to get tough on crime, let us deal with the causes of crime instead of using taxpayer money to incarcerate millions of people.
If Mr. Trump tries to pursue discriminatory policies, he should remember that a majority of voters did not support him and his bigotry.
We are rapidly moving toward a nation of the super-rich, by the super-rich and for the super-rich.
Believing in climate change is not optional at this point. Neither is taking action to save the planet.
Garnishing social security benefits to pay off student debt is a clear example of why we need fundamental changes in our national priorities
It is beyond absurd that so many bright young people are unable to attend college because of the cost.
We are moving toward an oligarchic form of society, and it will take all of us to fight against it.
Clinton received almost 3 million more votes, but Trump will be the next president. It's clear the electoral college needs to be changed.
Lowering prices on prescription drugs‚Äîthat is, making sure that people can afford to live‚Äîshould not be a partisan issue.
Every person in this country deserves a decent opportunity and a decent standard of living. Until that happens we will not truly be free.
It would be nice to put off worrying about climate change for a few decades. But the truth is we have no choice but to act now.
We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.
The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.
Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
Cuts to life and death programs like Medicare and massive tax breaks for the wealthy‚Äîthat's not what America is supposed to be about.
Even though the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana, a black person is almost 4x more likely to be arrested for possession.
Walmart costs taxpayers $6.2 billion every year in public assistance programs by not paying their workers a living wage. That is insane.
Congress must begin listening to the majority of Americans who do not want cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.
Our job is to grow the union movement so that anyone working 40 hours a week, whether it‚Äôs in a factory or a hotel, doesn't live in poverty.
A small subsection of the one percent are hell-bent on doing everything in their power to block action against climate change.
Young people in this country should be in good schools and at good jobs, not in jail cells.
There is hatred being generated against immigrants in this country. We've got to stand together and reject that hate.

Our job now is to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels, not to produce more greenhouse gas emissions.
In the year 2016, we should not continue to trample on Native American sovereignty or become more dependent on fossil fuel.

Our job is to tell the pharmaceutical industry that we won't continue to pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
If we beat the drug industry in California we are going to put them on the defensive and lower the cost of medication across this country.
High drug prices isn‚Äôt just about people dying, it‚Äôs about people having to go deeply into debt to get the medication they need.
Drug companies make huge profits and executives get big compensation package, while Americans die because they can't afford their medication
If you want to understand why we pay such high drug prices listen to this: Since 1998 the drug industry has spent $3 billion on lobbying.

Let us feed our children first, educate our children first, and worry about the military-industrial complex later!
Do we stand with the 20 percent of our children who live in poverty or the military-industrial complex pumping billions into bombers?
The middle class is still suffering from the horrendous damage financial institutions and insurance companies did to this country in 2008.
Some members of Congress ‚Äî  mostly men, I should add ‚Äî are trying to roll back the clock on women‚Äôs rights. We can't let that happen.

Election days come and go, but the struggle for economic, social, racial and environmental justice will always continue.
In 1977, 22 percent of all the jobs in this country were in manufacturing. Today, that figure is down to 8 percent.
For the first time in our history, American families have more student debt than credit card debt. That is an extraordinary reality.
Congress must ensure our elections belong to individual voters not billionaire donors.
Many children today enter kindergarten behind where they should be intellectually and emotionally because of inadequate childcare.
I am getting tired of being lectured by CEOs of large corporations who want to cut Social Security benefits in exchange for tax breaks.
The fact is that for many years, Republicans have been attempting to either cut Social Security or privatize it. We can't let that happen.
We "can't afford" benefits for some of the people who are struggling the hardest, but Congress has no issue with tax breaks for the Waltons.
All over the world, countries are saying, "Let us put an end to state murder. Let us stop capital punishment." Time for us to do the same.

The system is rigged when the average person works longer hours for lower wages, and over half of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.
Our job is not done. We must stand up and take on the billionaire class. That fight must continue the day after the election.

What Republicans are saying is that no woman in this country, has the right to control her own body. I strongly disagree.
Loudly and clearly, we must tell Republicans: no, we will not cut Social Security benefits for seniors and disabled veterans.

Republicans are waging a war against women and, let me be clear, it's not a war that we're gonna allow them to win.

The toxic chemicals used in fracking are known to cause lung cancer and birth defects. We must ban fracking and #KeepItInTheGround.
No amount of regulation can safely guard against the dangers fracking poses to our land, water, air, natural resources and public health.
We need to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next few years, and implement pay equity for women workers.
Fracking is a danger to our water supply, the air we breathe and it‚Äôs contributing to climate change. Time to phase out fracking nationwide.
With real unemployment near 10 percent, we need a jobs program to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of jobs.

Every American over 18 must be automatically registered to vote so that young people can make their voices heard at the ballot box.
We must put an end to discriminatory laws and the purging of minority-community names from voting rolls.
Change comes when the people demand it ‚Äî in the voting booth and on the streets in peaceful demonstrations.
We must remember that the struggle for our rights is not the struggle of a day, or a year. It is the struggle of a lifetime.
When the votes of minorities are suppressed, it becomes easier for politicians who represent billionaires to win and hold elected office.
I have a message for Donald Trump: No, we‚Äôre not going to hate Latinos or Muslims. We are going to stand together.
Make no mistake: the billionaire class does not want young and working people to vote.
In the shameful days of open segregation, literacy laws were used to suppress minority voting. Today, Republicans do it with photo ID laws.
Through a Prize Fund we can provide affordable access to medicines as soon as they are available on the market.

We must once again make our country the leader in the fight for economic and social justice, for environmental sanity and for peace.
If @realDonaldTrump wants to open the door to racism, it is our job to shut that door, and shut it tight.
The greed of the billionaire class is destroying this country and whether they like it or not we are going to stop that greed.
I believe we have a moral obligation to pursue diplomatic solutions before resorting to military intervention.
Trump suggested limiting immigration according to religion and creating a national database based on religion ‚Äì absolutely disgraceful.
To advance the cause of peace, the United States has also got to be a friend not only to Israel, but to the Palestinian people.
We have got to say to the fossil-fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.
At a time of massive inequality, the Republicans believe that the richest people in America need to be made even richer.
I hope the Republicans listen to what the Pope has to say. Denying the science related to climate change is no longer acceptable.

We need a grassroots movement to tell the Koch brothers and the billionaire class that they won't be able to continue to buy elections.
We are building a movement because this country belongs to all of us - not just a handful of billionaires and wealthy campaign contributors.
No president alone can effectively address the crises facing the working families of this country without a powerful grassroots movement.

That's just a "single issue" where @HillaryClinton and I differ.
In my view, we need to repeal the 1996 welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net.
In 2008, @HillaryClinton said that ‚Äúwelfare should not be an anti-poverty program.‚Äù I disagree.
This legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. That is unacceptable.
This legislation gave Republican governors like Scott Walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need.
In 1994, welfare provided a vital safety net to more than 14 million Americans. Today, it only helps 4.4 million.
Families LIVING IN POVERTY receiving cash benefits:
1996: 68%
2014: Only 23%
From 1996 to 2011, households living in EXTREME poverty increased 182% for African Americans; 132% for Hispanics; 109% for White Americans.
The number of children in extreme poverty has skyrocketed from 1.4 million to 3.5 million.
It established strict work requirements for receiving benefits and severely limited access to benefits for undocumented people.
Since this legislation was signed into law, families living in extreme poverty have more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.65 million.
It turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster.
Unfortunately, @HillaryClinton supported this bill calling it ‚Äúa critical first step to reforming our nation‚Äôs welfare system.‚Äù
I called that bill ‚Äúan assault on the poor, women and children, minorities, and immigrants.‚Äù I believed that then and I believe that now.
One of the biggest differences between the Clintons and myself in this campaign is our view on welfare reform.

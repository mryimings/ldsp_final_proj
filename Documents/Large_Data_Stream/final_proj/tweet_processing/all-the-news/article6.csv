53284,73462,Obama Built an ‘Infrastructure’ for Civil-Liberties Violations That Trump Will Inherit,Atlantic,Emma Green,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"President Obama’s farewell speech was an exercise in marking norms. Offering a clear message to his successor, he spoke about the importance of civil liberties and rejecting discrimination against Muslims. He argued that protecting the American “way of life” means “[guarding] against a weakening of the values that make us who we are,” highlighting his administration’s work “to put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. ” He went on: “That’s why we’ve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. ” He used forms of the word “democracy” 27 times. Surveillance, indefinite detention, counterterrorism, and torture have emerged as prominent issues during the Senate hearings about Donald Trump’s administration picks. It is not yet clear what Trump’s policies on these issues will be, although his comments on the campaign trail suggest he supports the use of torture, keeping Guantanamo Bay open, and surveilling mosques and certain American citizens, among other things. Why Trump’s    Plan Won’t Prevent Conflicts of Interest, But anything Trump does will be built on legal “infrastructure” created by the Obama administration, argues Jameel Jaffer, the former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. It may be true that Obama worked to create a sound legal basis for his administration’s   and surveillance policies, Jaffer said. But in doing so, he also gave his policies, many of which were extensions of the Bush era, a sense of permanence and legitimacy. Now, Trump will inherit the “firm legal footing” Obama helped created. During his time at the ACLU, Jaffer led litigation against the Obama administration on a number of   and transparency issues, and he recently wrote a book on the legal memos that enabled the administration’s policy on drone strikes. Jaffer currently leads the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and is an executive editor for the blog Just Security. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Emma Green: Let’s go through each of Obama’s claims. Here’s the first: His administration “put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. ” That’s kind of hard to parse, but seems to be a reference to policies put in place during the Bush administration. It’s broad, but how well do you think this claim holds up? Jameel Jaffer: The administration has a mixed record. They deserve credit for the disavowal of torture, the shuttering of the CIA’s black sites, and the commitment to close Guantanamo and the significant progress they made toward that goal. They deserve credit for the transparency decisions they made very early on in 2009 relating to the interrogation of prisoners. They also abandoned, or at least downplayed, arguments relating to the president’s authority as commander in chief. The Bush administration argued that the president had the authority to ignore statutory law with respect to surveillance, interrogation, and torture. Their argument was that the president gets to decide what our   policies are, and if Congress has legislated in the area of national security, the president has the authority as commander in chief to ignore that legislation. That was an extremely dangerous argument, and one that the courts ultimately rejected. The Obama administration was right to abandon those arguments. But I do think it’s important to recognize that in abandoning those constitutional arguments, the Obama administration ended up interpreting statutes very broadly. Obama didn’t argue that the president had the authority to ignore the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. He interpreted it to give him all the authority that he wanted. It was the same as Section 215 of the Patriot Act: The administration interpreted that provision so broadly that they didn’t have to rely on constitutional authority. They didn’t have to make the argument that the president, as commander in chief, has the authority to collect everybody’s call records because they were interpreting the federal statute so broadly that it allowed whatever they wanted it to. Green: Here’s another claim: The Obama administration “ended torture. ” Does that stand, as a categorical statement? Jaffer: He’s right about that. This is an important thing that his administration did on the first day, which is to expressly disavow torture, withdraw the legal memos that were the basis of the torture program, close the CIA’s black sites permanently. Those were important decisions and the administration deserves credit for them. The caveat, which is an important one, is that after having done all of those things on day one, the administration invoked the   privilege over and over to prevent those who had been the victims of these policies from having their day in court. People who sought accountability for their torture in CIA custody or in military custody were kicked out of court because the administration argued that those cases were too sensitive to litigate. Green: Another claim he made was that his administration worked to “reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. ” To what extent do you think that holds up? Jaffer: There were some changes made by Congress in the summer of 2015, which the administration supported. The changes were modest, and came about only because Snowden disclosed what he disclosed. But for those disclosures, none of those reforms would have taken place. The administration still characterizes Snowden as a criminal. There’s an irony in the Obama administration trying to take credit for these positive changes in the law while also trying to prosecute the person who is most responsible for bringing these changes about. Green: The Obama administration’s aggressive prosecution of whistleblowers stands in contrast to some of the claims he made in his speech about protecting civil liberties. How does that policy connect to some of these issues? Jaffer: This administration came in saying this would be the most transparent administration in the history of the United States. Over time, they became more closed and less forthcoming. They withheld many of the most crucial documents related to   policy, including the drone memos, until courts ordered them to release them, and information about government surveillance, until Snowden disclosed that information. And they brought more prosecutions against government whistleblowers than all previous administrations combined. Green: How does the administration’s drone policy fit into Obama’s legacy on national security and transparency? Jaffer: The phrase Obama used was putting “the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. ” The other way to look at it is that this administration has normalized and entrenched many of the policies of the last administration. It would have been possible, eight years ago, to think of the Bush administration’s policies as aberrational —  to see them as a reaction, and an overreaction, to the events of  . It’s no longer possible to see these policies that way because the Obama administration has endorsed so many of them. With respect to the drone campaign, that’s especially true: The Obama administration built a bureaucratic infrastructure to support this practice of targeted killing. It expanded the program dramatically. It now carries out, routinely, strikes in seven different countries most of those countries are not conventional battlefields. I don’t think President Bush would have been able to expand the drone campaign in the way that Obama eventually did. Now we’ve invested all this power in the presidency, and all that power will be available to President Trump and whoever comes after President Trump. Green: What’s the outlook for some of these issues, in your view, with the incoming administration? Jaffer: Given the some of the statements of candidate Trump during the campaign, and given the track records of some of the people who are advising him at the highest levels, I think there are a lot of reasons to worry about how the new administration will use the powers that President Obama created or put on a relatively sound legal footing: the power to detain, the power to surveil, the power to kill. The   has already made clear that he wants to use some of these powers even more aggressively: He wants to step up surveillance inside the United States, especially of Muslims. He wants to expand the war on terror. He has proposed resurrecting the torture policies. [In November, Trump told The New York Times that he has changed his view on this issue after consulting with his   for Secretary of Defense, the retired U. S. Marine Corps General James Mattis.] It’s difficult to know which of these promises will translate into actual policy, but there’s certainly reason to worry that these powers will be used even more aggressively and in an even less discriminating way than they’ve been used until now."
53285,73463,Why Trump’s Conflict-of-Interest Plan Won’t Prevent Conflicts of Interest,Atlantic,Clare Foran,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"Updated on January 11 at 5:56 p. m. ET,   Donald Trump announced at a press conference Wednesday that he is transferring control of his company to his sons, a plan that falls far short of what ethics experts have advised for the   to prevent conflicts of interest as a result of his business entanglements. The steps announced Wednesday won’t resolve Trump’s potential conflicts of interest, according to Norman Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Obama. “Mr. Trump’s   course will precipitate scandal and corruption,” Eisen said in an   arguing that when he assumes the presidency, Trump will be poised to violate a provision of the Constitution intended to prevent foreign governments from buying influence in the U. S. government.​ Later on Wednesday, U. S. Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub denounced Trump’s plans in no uncertain terms. “This isn’t the way the presidency has worked since Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act in 1978 in the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal,” he said at a forum convened by the Brookings Institution in Washington, D. C. The criticism Trump faces from ethics experts is bipartisan: Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, also criticized Trump’s stated plans during the forum. “The plan we heard today is not compliant with the law,” Painter warned. “The   has nine days to fix this problem. ” Trump ran on the promise that his success as a businessman would translate into a successful presidency. But in the aftermath of the election, Trump has faced pressure to resolve potential conflicts of interest posed by his business dealings. On Wednesday, he explained that his “two sons . .. Don and Eric are going to be running the company. ” He added: “They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They’re not going to discuss it with me. ” A lawyer working on Trump’s behalf, Sheri Dillon, elaborated on the  : “Through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump organization to his sons, Don and Eric, and a longtime Trump executive Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric, and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization, and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by   Trump. ”   Dillon went on to say that “an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team” as part of the trust agreement, that “Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump organization entities,” and that Trump has created “a new position at the Trump Organization: the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses are operating at the highest levels of integrity. ” Additionally, Trump will “voluntarily donate all profits from   payments made to his hotels to the U. S. Treasury. ” Dillon added: “This way it is the American people who will profit. ” Notably, however, the plans do not meet the criteria that ethics experts have advised: Trump will not sell and fully divest from his business assets or put them into a blind trust. The point of a blind trust is to set up an impermeable barrier between the person placing their holdings into the trust and the person managing the trust. By giving his sons and an employee control over the trust instead, Trump virtually guarantees that the buffer between himself and his business interests will be porous. Trump may insist that his sons won’t discuss the business with him, but there is no way for the American public to know that for certain. With his family members in control of the organization, Trump is far more likely to find out the details of business transactions, even if only inadvertently, as opposed to if he had placed his assets into a blind trust. In Politico, Eisen, along with Painter and Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe, outlined criteria by which to judge Trump’s plans to avoid conflicts of interest. The article makes a series of recommendations, including that Trump should “make a clean break from ownership of his businesses, not just operations,” “divest into a true blind trust,” and “use a truly independent trustee, not a family member. ” Reacting to Wednesday’s announcement, Eisen emphasized that Trump failed to adhere to any of those ethical guidelines in outlining his new plan. “Mr. Trump did not make a clean break with his   interests as his predecessors for four decades have done did not establish a blind trust or the equivalent as bipartisan experts and [Office of Government Ethics] called for entrusted trust responsibility in his family and a current employee, rather than in an independent trustee.   …     And offered an inadequate and   ethics wall. ” Dillon argued that setting up a blind trust or selling the business weren’t feasible options on Wednesday. “Selling first and foremost would not eliminate possibilities of conflict of interest,” she said, adding that “if   Trump sold his brand he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it” and “further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny” and questions of   . Dillon also argued that you “cannot have a totally blind trust with operating business. ” In addition to the other ethics concerns he raised, Eisen argued that the decision to direct Trump hotel revenue from foreign governments to the U. S. Treasury fails to at all comply with the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which legal experts have explained is intended to prevent corruption as a result of payments from foreign governments. Trump’s plan “did not screen all ‘emoluments   …     of any kind whatever,’ as required by the Constitution, but only some revenues, and only from his hotels,” Eisen wrote over  . He elaborated: “The Emoluments Clause doesn’t only cover some hotel revenues, as the Trump team wrongly believes, but applies to a much broader range of   benefits that Trump is collecting, and will continue to collect, from foreign governments. On January 20, that will be in direct violation of the Constitution. ” As a result of lingering ethics questions, Trump’s   press conference will not put to rest concerns over his potential conflicts of interest. Now, the question is how much pressure from Congress or the public Trump will continue to face, and whether he will see fit to take any additional action. Office of Government Ethics Director Shaub noted on Wednesday that “there’s still time to . .. come up with something that will resolve these conflicts. ” He went on to add, however, that “nothing short of divestiture will resolve” the potential conflicts facing Trump. Prior to Wednesday’s press conference, Pew Research found that a majority of Americans are indeed concerned that Trump will be exposed to potential conflicts of interest. If that concern does not lessen, the   may feel compelled to do more."
53286,73464,The Irrationally Divided Critics of Donald Trump,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"A large cohort of Americans have reservations about the presidency of Donald Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2. 9 million, strikes many who did vote for him as a highly flawed “lesser of two evils,” and has a dismal 37 percent approval rating. These ideologically diverse skeptics must cooperate if they hope to minimize the damage they believe the Trump Administration will do to America if left unopposed. But so far, they are easily divided. In fact, they cannot even refrain from attacking or alienating one another on matters where they are mostly in agreement. This   approach was illustrated earlier this week when Never Trump conservatives who fully believe that Donald Trump is a bully watched Meryl Streep level that criticism. Rather than embracing a rare moment of narrow convergence with a Hollywood liberal, they let the mutual antagonism between their cultural tribes drive their reaction and wound up furiously attacking the actress over perceived hypocrisy. Doing so advanced none of their ends. It was a missed opportunity. Another immediate example concerns the upcoming Woman’s March on Washington, D. C. where critics of Donald Trump will protest the day after his inauguration.  Here’s how a New York Times article on preparations for the event began: Many thousands of women are expected to converge on the nation’s capital for the Women’s March on Washington the day after Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. Jennifer Willis no longer plans to be one of them. Ms. Willis, a    wedding minister from South Carolina, had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march. Then she read a post on the Facebook page for the march that made her feel unwelcome because she is white. The post, written by a black activist from Brooklyn who is a march volunteer, advised “white allies” to listen more and talk less. It also chided those who, it said, were only now waking up to racism because of the election. “You don’t just get to join because now you’re scared, too,” read the post. “I was born scared. ” Stung by the tone, Ms. Willis canceled her trip. “This is a women’s march,” she said. “We’re supposed to be allies in equal pay, marriage, adoption. Why is it now about, ‘White women don’t understand black women’?” For many, this was yet another illustration of identity politics undermining the effectiveness of leftist activism. There are discrete features of some identity politics that frustrate me too. Many manifestations of tribalism are doing dangerous harm to liberal democracy. And I certainly think it is foolish for a political organizer collaborating on a protest to tell anyone, “You don’t just get to join now because you’re scared. ” “Yes, we can!” works much better. But I find fault with Ms. Willis, too. The wedding minister from South Carolina apparently believes that Donald Trump threatens sound policy on a host of vitally important issues, and that marching on Washington will help diminish his power to do harm. Given those beliefs, it seems rather small to cancel her attendance because one Brooklyn activist wrote a Facebook post that she found wrongheaded. To stand up for their beliefs, Americans have defied a king by signing their names to parchment that could’ve been a death warrant, parachuted into Germany to fight fascists to the death, and braved Bull Connor’s attack dogs. Are we now too fragile to attend a march of many thousands when one of them hurts our feelings before the fact? To borrow advice that Nicholas Christakis once sagely offered, if you don’t like someone’s behavior, “look away, or tell them you are offended. Talk to each other. ” Don’t withdraw to a safe space, abandoning much that is more important than stung feelings. The New York Times article offered more examples of   tension, then added that “no one involved with the march fears that the rancor will dampen turnout even many of those who expressed dismay at the tone of the discussion said they still intended to join what is sure to be the largest demonstration yet against the Trump presidency. ” If that is indeed the ultimate outcome it will be blessedly rational. There is no reason that people who disagree, even deeply, on the wisdom or optimal contours of intersectional feminism cannot also agree to cooperate fully in opposing Trump. Which faction is correct need not affect this cooperation. Yet large swaths of the right and left, including extremely thoughtful,   observers of the American scene, are behaving as if such cooperation is impossible. Even those who purport to reject all kinds of identity politics are unwittingly presuming its supremacy in their analysis. Comparing Meryl Streep, who delivered a message to a room full of Hollywood liberals who were certain to applaud it, and Mark Lilla, who published a broadside against identity politics in the New York Times that many on the left were sure to attack, Rod Dreher writes, “Meryl Streep is not a brave liberal. Michael Eric Dyson is not a brave liberal. Mark Lilla is a brave liberal. ” There’s a salvageable insight there. Only Lilla risked the ire of his own tribe, and that does require admirable traits. Still, is it more brave to suffer the zings of woke Twitter than to humiliate a famously vindictive personality poised to be the most powerful head of state on the planet? Odds are the actress and the academic will both be fine, but fearing criticism from a faction that holds most of its power on social media more than a combative leader in a world where such people sometimes keep enemies’ lists makes no sense. Meanwhile, down in the comments of that same post, a leftist Rod Dreher reader declares that he’s glad the woman who’s no longer attending the   rally will stay home: No one is mourning the loss of the woman you quoted. She was never truly “on our side. ” She was, very likely, the kind of   person who was happy to go along with the removal of industrial employment and it’s replacement with   service jobs for reasons of economic efficiency. She was likely the kind of person who was so afraid of minorities doing crimes that she was prepared to countenance the warehousing of all those surplus men in the American gulag. She is not a loss to any movement aimed at historical rectification in favor of equality. Perhaps if this individual marches alone down the street the unprecedented purity of his demonstration will persuade all who see him that his politics are the only way forward. But I’d place my bets on a massive   march full of hopelessly impure rogues. There is no crisis caused by debating identity politics or anything that falls under its rubric from any direction. But a crisis will come if that debate is weighted so heavily that those on opposite sides proceed as if they could not possibly share any values, agree on any goals, retain any respect for one another, or cooperate at all, even as their shared political opponent, who exercises orders of magnitude more power than all of them combined, behaves in ways that all regard as catastrophic for the United States. A large, diverse cohort of Americans have reservations about the presidency of Donald Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2. 9 million, strikes many who did vote for him as a highly flawed “lesser of two evils,” and has a dismal 37 percent approval rating. They should treat those reservations as if they matter commensurate with their gravity, breaking ingrained culture war habits that are no longer rational."
53287,73465,"Rex Tillerson Says Climate Change Is Real, but …",Atlantic,Robinson Meyer,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"As chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson admitted that climate change is real. In January 2009, he said the company was in favor of a carbon tax. A few years later, Exxon endorsed the Paris Agreement. It was never clear whether Exxon’s leaders actually supported those policies or whether they were trying to put their best PR foot forward (or whether it mattered either way). But now Tillerson is the Secretary of   for a man who not only rejects the Paris treaty, but who also once tweeted that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. What does Tillerson really think about global warming —  and will it matter? On Wednesday, at his ongoing confirmation hearings in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we’ve gotten four big glances at his views on the issue: 1. Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat of New Mexico, pressed Tillerson to share his “personal view” of climate change. Tillerson replied that after 20 years as a scientist and engineer, he had concluded that “the risk of climate change does exist. ” He also believed “action should be taken,” though he neither went into detail nor left the passive voice. “Do you believe that human activity, based on science, is contributing?” asked Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “The increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is having an effect. Our ability to predict that effect is very limited,” Tillerson answered. A few notes here. First, as Inside Climate News points out, Tillerson never connected emissions from fossil fuels to the rise in   levels. But oil, gas, and coal combustion contribute not only most of the ongoing global warming but also all of the ongoing ocean acidification. Second, Tillerson is careful to frame climate change as a future risk and not an ongoing reality. Yet the last three years have been the warmest ever recorded, and the U. S. East Coast is already seeing elevated sea levels, especially in South Florida. Most scientists also feel quite certain about many of the ill effects of climate change. Still, it pointed to a potential shift in the Republican Party’s treatment of climate change. If some party members stop debating whether global warming is real (it is) and begin discussing what to do about it, the odd politics of the issue in the United States could begin to change. 2. Tillerson made comments about international climate treaties that —  in any reasonable reading —  do not agree with those of Donald Trump. “I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response. No one country is going to solve this alone,” he said. Immediately after Trump’s victory, there were hints that he may direct the United States to leave the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the overarching (and Congressionally ratified) treaty to address global warming. It’s hard to reconcile the U. S. “maintaining its seat at the table” with its abandoning the UNFCCC, as that would leave the U. S. unable to attend the UN’s annual meeting on climate change. It’s less clear what his comment means for the Paris Agreement. Since presidents ultimately set all policy, it’s also unclear whether Tillerson’s opinions about climate diplomacy may matter. But as the leader of an American business, it makes sense that he would see American engagement in global affairs as worthwhile. 3. Tillerson clarified his support for a carbon tax. When he announced Exxon’s endorsement of a carbon tax on January 9, 2009, it was because he opposed the incoming Obama administration’s plans for a    plan, he told the committee. Back then, he called a carbon tax “a more direct, a more transparent, and a more effective approach. ” He largely echoed that reasoning on Wednesday. “It replaces the hodgepodge of approaches we have today, which are scattered. Some of which are through mandates, some of which are   but ineffective incentives,” Tillerson told Udall. He also liked that a carbon tax would not increase the size of the government. “If a carbon tax is put in place, it has to be  . All the revenues have to go back out to the economy through reduced employee payroll taxes,” he said. “This is simply a mechanism to incentivize choices that people are making. It’s not a  . ” Tillerson did not commit to working for a carbon tax while secretary of state. 4. Tillerson got the senators to laugh about the notion of harassing the civil service. In early December, the Trump transition team circulated a survey among employees at the Department of Energy. It sought to learn, among other things, about which employees had worked on or studied climate issues and about who had attended international climate meetings with Obama political appointees. In response to ferocious opposition, the transition team withdrew the survey later that week. At the hearing, Udall asked Tillerson whether he would seek out or persecute State Department employees who had worked on climate issues for the Obama administration. “No sir, that’d be a pretty unhelpful way to get started,” replied Rex. The committee chuckled. Amid all of this, the loudest voice in the room about climate change wasn’t from a senator or the nominee. Throughout the morning, protesters stood up in the gallery and shouted their opposition to the proceedings. “Exxon wants to drill and burn the Arctic,” yelled a woman with graying hair. “Please don’t put Exxon in charge of the State Department. Protect our children and grandchildren!” she shouted. A Capitol Police officer escorted her out. Corker said he would “stop the clock” and allow senators their full questioning time whenever the proceedings were interrupted. The hearing continued."
53288,73466,The Biggest Intelligence Questions Raised by the Trump Dossier,Atlantic,Amy Zegart,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"I’ve spent nearly 20 years looking at intelligence challenges, including failures. That means getting into what I call the “silent but deadly” organizational causes of failure —  so while the news tends to gravitate toward the salacious elements of a story like allegations about   Donald Trump that broke Tuesday night, and ask what’s true and what’s not, there are organizational questions that this new reporting raises about how well the intelligence community is working. With intelligence, the devil really does lie in the details, so it’s important to distinguish between what we know the community has said, and what they don’t know yet. In the case of CNN’s report that senior intelligence officials had told both Trump and President Obama “Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump,” neither the FBI nor the numerous news organizations that have been investigating those allegations have verified their substance. The memos detailing them, released by Buzzfeed shortly after CNN’s story broke, came not from the intelligence community itself but from a person claiming to be a former operative with the British intelligence service MI6 who compiled them “over a period of months” while conducting opposition research on behalf of Trump’s political rivals, both Republican and Democrat. That material from the former MI6 official may not be all of what the intelligence agencies have the “compromising” information about   Trump that “Russian operatives” reportedly claim to possess may not be what they actually possess and what they actually possess may not be completely, or even partially, true. Here are my top four unknowns as I read this story: 1) Trump team communications with the Russian government before the election, Did anyone in the Trump orbit —  intermediaries, campaign staff, family, confidants —  know that the reported information was in the hands of the Russian government before the election? Did anyone in the Trump orbit communicate with Russian government officials before the election as the documents allege? (Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen, for example, was not in Prague in August 2016, when the documents allege he was there meeting with Kremlin officials.) If anyone else in Trump’s orbit was, were these new allegations the subject of any communications? 2) Whether the FBI screwed up, What did the FBI do once it got the memos in August 2016, when reports say the former MI6 agent first approached an FBI official in Rome? Who took what steps, and why? Why didn’t the public hear anything about this matter until five months after the FBI received the memos? CNN does not report on when exactly the FBI in Washington got the information only that the Rome contact took place in August. So it is possible the FBI was slow in reacting to the initial “over the transom” communication in Rome. I’d like to know the precise timeline of activity from the point of first contact to better understand whether the bureau should have been moving with greater effort and urgency on a matter of such significance. Four possibilities: a) Organizational fragmentation. The FBI is highly decentralized into 56 field offices, with a history of left   hand coordination problems —  which explains why, before   three different field offices each had clues about the plot, but nobody knew what the others knew, so more concerted action was never taken. Was this another case of coordination problems impeding success? b) Cultural pathologies. FBI culture is still rooted in   which means it’s slow and careful, oriented toward collecting evidence for a court after something bad has already happened. An intelligence culture, by contrast, is focused on prevention, speed, and integration —  pulling and weaving together threads as fast as possible to prevent disaster. c)  Misjudgment. FBI Director James Comey misjudged when and with whom to share this information. We’ve seen this movie before. d) Degree of difficulty. The FBI didn’t do anything wrong. The investigation was hard —  getting greater confidence and protecting sources and methods took time. 3) Is the   intelligence report officials provided to Trump and Obama, which in part summarizes the longer set of memos compiled by the former MI6 agent and made public by Buzzfeed, primarily aimed at the past or the future? Does the revelation that the Russians have this supposedly embarrassing information (whether it is true or false) suggest an ongoing risk that the   could be pressured by a foreign power into taking actions that are not in the best interests of the United States? One key lesson in intelligence: Information need not be true to be damaging. 4) The obvious unknown:  Is the embarrassing information about Mr. Trump true?  CNN reports that, in the time since the former MI6 operative approached the FBI over the summer, “US intelligence agencies have now checked out [him] and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough” to warrant briefing the president and   on his findings. Many of Tuesday’s reports, in other words, depend on the credibility of one anonymous source and what he told the intelligence community. The cautionary tale there is that “Curveball,” an Iraqi defector the U. S. relied on to build its case about WMD in Iraq, was also thought to be credible —  until many of his claims proved false. And, as Buzzfeed notes, the full document contains errors of spelling and fact. The fact that the intelligence officials thought the allegations serious enough to bring to the attention of the president and the   is something we need to give serious weight to. But there’s also an unprecedented element in this story, which concerns claims about politicization of intelligence. What intelligence officials don’t want to have is for news to leak before the president or   sees it directly —  they want Obama and Trump to hear it from them first. Then the problem is, once that’s happened and the news leaks anyway, it seems to have more credibility precisely because it was brought to such   attention."
53289,73467,Trump Announces Plan That Does Little to Resolve His Conflicts of Interest,Atlantic,Jeremy Venook,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"  Donald Trump will not be taking necessary steps to resolve his conflicts of interest before he takes office. At his press conference today —  his first since June 2016 —  Trump and his lawyer Sheri Dillon laid out the plans that they claimed would resolve the questions about conflicts of interest that have dogged the   since he was elected. Instead, what they announced were piecemeal steps that, though designed and packaged to mitigate the appearance of conflicts of interest, do almost nothing to substantively address concerns that his business entanglements will undermine his ability to faithfully execute the office of the presidency. The first of these steps, presaged by numerous reports from both within and outside the Trump Organization and his transition team, was to relinquish his official leadership roles within his company. In his stead, Trump’s two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, will be running    operations with a longtime associate of their father’s, with what so far amounts to a   assurance that they will not discuss any aspect of the business with the  . As has been previously written numerous times, such an arrangement does nothing to actually mitigate conflicts of interest Trump’s relationship to his sons, who are members of his transition team, among his closest advisers, and, perhaps most importantly, his children, is far too close for their stated arrangement to qualify as a blind trust. Additionally, Dillon’s description of how Trump will divorce himself from knowledge of their dealings does little to resolve the overarching problem of his   knowledge of his empire. The president’s holdings both in the United States and around the world are vast and highly visible it is unreasonable to assert that reducing official reports to just the company’s overall profits and losses will prevent him from knowing if a policy or position will be beneficial to his company, a problem to which Dillon herself alluded by asserting that the   “can’t   he owns Trump Tower. ” Similarly, Trump intends to create two positions, one within the government and one within his company, to act as ethical watchdogs over his behavior. These roles offer little reassurance unless the   or someone on his team spells out a   way by which Trump will be held to these standards. In fact, arguably the only one of the many steps Trump and Dillon announced that will actually reduce the potential for conflicts of interest is their pledge that the Trump Organization would be pursuing no new foreign deals while Trump is in office. However, considering that Trump had previously promised no new deals, period, and considering the numerous properties and deals already underway around the world, the promise does little to assuage concerns that Trump’s business will influence his presidency. Dillon offered two preemptive defenses against the ethical and legal questions that Trump is likely to take once he takes office. The first is a reading of the   Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which makes it illegal for federal officeholders to “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state. ” According to Dillon, agents of foreign governments staying at Trump hotels do not violate this clause because it does not apply to “  exchanges,” and “no one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. ” This, it should be said, is a minority position. Numerous experts, most notably Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, and the constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe, have already voiced their disagreements in no uncertain terms, stating without reservation that Trump’s continued ownership of his properties will violate the Constitution the day he enters office. Moreover, the workaround Trump’s legal team has apparently created —  donating profits from foreign governments’ payments to the U. S. Treasury —  does nothing to change the fact that governments will likely attempt to curry favor with the president through his hotel, as he may view that as flattering, not to mention the hotel will still collect revenues on the stay. Their second defense was one that Trump has repeatedly asserted since the election: The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties does not apply to the president or vice president. In this regard, they are correct the law, passed in 1989, exempts the two chief executives from    rules on the understanding that their purview is so broad that it would be almost impossible for them to completely disentangle themselves. Regardless, legality does not imply propriety. Unless Trump acts to put actual distance between himself and his business ventures —  and today’s press conference seems to indicate that he won’t —  these questions will likely continue throughout his time in the Oval Office. Already, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Michael Shaub, has declared Trump’s plans insufficient, remarking, “I don’t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States,” and a number of Senate Democrats have introduced legislation that would force Trump to divest or face impeachment. Below is an attempt to catalogue the more   examples of conflicts of interest that have emerged so far the most recent entries appear at the top. Those Indonesian Politicians, Despite   Donald Trump’s assurance that he has stopped pursuing deals since the election, his namesake organization is currently moving forward with a pair of projects in Indonesia. According to The New York Times, the two properties that will bear the Trump name, one overlooking a Hindu temple in Bali and the other abutting a theme park in West Java, presented ethical problems even before the election. To begin with, through his Indonesian partner on the projects, the billionaire media mogul Hary Tanoesoedibjo (known in Indonesia as Hary Tanoe) Trump has forged relationships with several top Indonesian politicians. One such leader is Setya Novanto, the speaker of the country’s House of Representatives who temporarily lost his post for trying to extort $4 billion from the American mining company   (a company which counts Carl Icahn, who will be serving as a special adviser in Trump’s administration, among its largest shareholders, and which has been frequently criticized by labor advocates and environmentalists). Trump had lunch with Novanto and several other Indonesian politicians during the campaign in September 2015 to discuss the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia. At a   press conference, Trump pulled Novanto in front of the cameras, calling him “an amazing man” and “one of the most powerful men” and asserting, “we will do great things for the United States. ” (It is unclear exactly whom Trump meant when he used the word “we. ”) Trump then asked Novanto to confirm that “they like me in Indonesia,” which Novanto did. Another of the politicians who attended the lunch with Trump is Fadli Zon, the vice chairman of Indonesia’s House of Representatives, whse district includes one of the cities in which one of the   properties will be built. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Zon is associated with a political movement seeking to unseat and jail the current governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known by his nickname, Ahok, and has spoken at rallies against Ahok. The   movement is rooted partly in centuries of ethnic tension within the country: Ahok is both Christian, which has made him the target of attacks by hardline clerics claiming to represent Indonesia’s Muslim majority, and a member of the country’s historically oppressed Chinese minority, which was the target of a massacre in 1998. Aside from an interim governor appointed half a century ago, Ahok is the first governor of Jakarta to fall into either category, and is currently on trial for blasphemy for allegedly insulting the Koran, although Ahok’s supporters claim that it is Ahok’s accusers who are guilty of blasphemy for denigrating Ahok’s Christianity. Both Trump’s question to Novanto and Zon’s presence at the meeting underscore another difficulty the   introduces into the United States’ relations with Indonesia. Indonesia is both the largest predominantly Muslim country in the world and the nation with the largest population of Muslims. Novanto received significant blowback for his statement that, yes, Indonesians do like Trump, because it turns out that, no, many Indonesians don’t like Trump, in large part because of his     proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the U. S. in fact, faced with mounting criticism, Novanto’s party apologized not only for Novanto’s statement but also for his mere attendance at the luncheon. Since Trump’s victory, both Novanto and Zon have stood up for the   arguing that Trump’s hardline stance toward Muslim immigration was merely campaign rhetoric and not actually reflective of the  ’s own beliefs, something Novanto claimed Trump personally assured him was the case. Regardless, it is clear that the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia —  which, again, is the reason Trump met with Novanto and Zon in the first place —  could introduce major complications into the relationship between the   and the political leaders of the world’s largest Muslim country, not to mention a significant trade partner and an important ally in the South China Sea region. As if that weren’t enough, Tanoe himself has shown increasing interest in becoming involved in Indonesian politics. In 2014, Tanoe publicly supported the retired general Prabowo Subianto in the nation’s presidential election Subianto lost to the country’s current leader, Joko Widodo. Then, in 2015, he helped found a new political party, the United Indonesia Party, or Partai Perindo, which intends to field candidates for national office in the near future, including Tanoe himself: Shortly after The New York Times reported on the project, Tanoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that, “If there is no one I can believe who can fix the problems of the country, I may try to run for president. ” If Tanoe does so, it will create the possibility that Trump will be dealing with a head of state with whom he has shared business interests, which, as Richard Painter told The New York Times, “makes it impossible to conduct diplomacy in an evenhanded manner” —  especially considering that, after Trump’s election, stock in Tanoe’s company rose significantly. Moreover, Tanoe, like Ahok, is both Christian and ethnically Chinese, which some insiders consider an obstacle to his electoral chances, although Tanoe argues that it is not Ahok’s religion but his lack of firm leadership that has led to the   protests against the governor. Nevertheless, if Tanoe does choose to run for office, it is difficult to see how his race, religion, and business partnership with a   many see as blatantly Islamophobic could do anything other than create further difficulties both within Indonesia and in the country’s relationship with the U. S.. In other words, even though Trump’s projects in Indonesia are only in the planning phase, they have already created a remarkably complicated situation among the   and politicians and businesspeople involved in the country’s political scandals and ethnic divisions. Even if Trump avoids active involvement in the   process for the properties in Bali and Java, he will likely still be profiting off of them, jeopardizing his ability to appropriately interact with the nation’s leadership.  Back to table of contents, That Emirati Businessman, Though the biggest controversy over the New Year’s Eve celebration at    Trump’s Florida estate, was apparently whether or not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as having “partied” there, video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day brought renewed scrutiny to   Donald Trump’s own presence at the event. During a   speech given in front of the party’s   attendees, Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani’s family, saying, “The most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight, and they’re seeing it and they love it. ” CNN identifies Sajwani as a “billionaire developer in Dubai” who has “paid Trump millions of dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai. ” Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, defended the remarks by clarifying that the   and Sajwani “had no formal meetings of professional discussions. Their interactions were social. ” Whether or not Hicks’s statement was true, Trump’s commendation of Sajwani is part of a pattern in which the   praises his business partners in ways that suggest he has little interest in extricating himself from his company’s interests. Previously, he has   business partners in Turkey and Argentina while on official calls with the countries’ leaders he also met, and took photos, with associates from India shortly after the election. Moreover, as with several of the countries in which   buildings are located, the United Arab Emirates has a questionable record on human rights Human Rights Watch specifically states that the nation “uses its affluence to mask the government’s   problems. ” By singling out Sajwani, Trump also runs headlong into accusations that he and his family are selling access to his administration through their organization and family foundations. According to Politico, tickets to celebrate with the   at    went for upwards of $500 the stated attendance of at least 800 people means that the Trump Organization made at least $400, 000 off of ticket sales for the event. (There is no indication that the party was a fundraiser for any outside organization, such as a charity or campaign fund, as is often the case when politicians attend such an event.) Whether or not the   sees it as such, the event offered attendees the opportunity to be in the same room as Trump and bend his ear for a price. This follows consternation regarding an auction for a    meeting with Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and a charity event that offered a reception with the   and a hunting trip with his two sons, both of which have since been cancelled, as well as ongoing speculation that foreign entities will attempt to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms and events at his hotel in Washington, D. C. That Trump singled out Sajwani at the New Year’s Eve party lends credence to these concerns —  it’s an instance of someone receiving the  ’s attention simply by buying a ticket to one of his events.  Back to table of contents, That Virginia Vineyard, Among the dozens of properties   Donald Trump owns is Trump Vineyard Estates and Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, the source of his namesake wine. Since Trump was elected, the property has requested temporary   visas for six foreign workers, according to The Washington Post. The visas, which are administered by the Citizenship and Immigration Services wing of the Department of Homeland Security, allow businesses to temporarily hire foreign, unskilled workers provided that the employer proves that there are not enough domestic candidates to fulfill a   or seasonal shortage and that the hiring will not depress wages for U. S.  employees. Trump, of course, will be in charge of appointing a new Secretary of Homeland Security once he assumes the presidency, which gives Trump authority over the very department responsible for deciding whether to grant the visas that the vineyard has requested. His current nominee, retired general John Kelly, has a relatively scant track record when it comes to immigration, leaving open the question of how much influence Trump himself will have over the DHS’s policy on the matter. On top of the fact that Trump will soon be able to influence the outcome of the request, that his organization has continued to request visas after his election underscores a tension in the  ’s stance on immigration. From the moment that he announced that he would be running for president, Trump made antagonism toward immigration the central aspect of his campaign, arguing that both legal and illegal immigrants are taking jobs that should be filled by   Americans and depressing wages for others. Though he did not specifically single out the   visa, the   has on multiple occasions spoken critically about the   program, which enables employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for skilled jobs like those in the tech industry. But the Trump Organization has long been a beneficiary of immigrant labor. For example, according to a Reuters report from August 2015, nine companies of which Trump is the majority owner have requested at least 1, 100 foreign visas since 2000. The majority of these requests were from Trump’s    Club in Florida, which has requested at least 787 foreign visas since 2006, including 70 applications in 2015. (Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that, since 2010, only 17 of the nearly 300 domestic applicants for positions at the    have been hired.) The Trump Organization also famously may have benefited from illegal immigration: There is significant evidence that many of the Polish construction workers at the Trump Tower construction site in New York in 1980 were in the country illegally. In other words, Trump’s track record includes not just taking advantage of the very visa process he claims to abhor but also actually subverting existing law for his own profit. Now, by applying for visas for his vineyard, Trump is signaling that he expects that his business will continue to be able to profit from one of the very immigration programs he continually denounces.  Back to table of contents, That Las Vegas Labor Dispute, On top of owning various properties and enterprises, Trump and his company employ roughly 34, 000 people, according to an analysis by CNN. On December 21, several hundred of those workers resolved  a labor dispute against the   —  one in which, had it continued for even a few weeks more, Trump would have had the unprecedented power to make appointments to affect its outcome. Here’s the situation: In October 2015, several hundred employees, primarily housekeeping staff, at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas voted to join the local branch of the Culinary Workers Union. Trump Ruffin Commercial LLC, which owns the hotel and is itself owned by Trump and the casino magnate Phil Ruffin, contested the vote, first by enlisting an   consulting firm (for whose services it paid $500, 000) and then by filing complaints with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Shortly before the election, the NLRB not only rejected Trump and Ruffin’s complaints but also found that, because the pair had refused to negotiate with the nascent union, they had violated federal law and their hotel was operating illegally. Trump and Ruffin have since appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On December 21, more than a year after the hotel’s workers first voted to join the union, the workers announced that they arrived at their first first   contract, achieved, according to an employee quoted in ThinkProgress, despite significant pressure from ownership that attempting to unionize would cost workers their jobs. According to the union, the new agreement “will provide the employees with annual wage increases, a pension, family health care, and job security” comparable to that of other Las Vegas hotels. Moreover, the Culinary Workers Union’s parent organization, UNITE HERE, has reached an agreement to represent workers at Trump’s   hotel in Washington, D. C.. Although this dispute has been resolved, it is included here because it exemplifies the type of situation in which Trump’s business interests are likely to overlap with his duties as president. Once he assumes office, Trump will be tasked with appointing members to fill current openings on the NLRB, the very body that ruled against him shortly before the election and will be tasked with resolving any future disputes between the hotel’s owners and its employees. Moreover, as Slate noted, the chief justice of the D. C. Court of Appeals is none other than Merrick Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court has spent months languishing in the   Congress and will likely be withdrawn once Trump becomes president. Finally, if disputes of this nature go beyond the Court of Appeals, the case would go to the Supreme Court, to which Trump will be appointing a justice once he assumes office, which is expected to tip the balance decisively in a more conservative (and likely  ) direction. In other words, no matter how far up the chain future disputes of this nature go, Trump’s presidency will give him new power to influence the results.  Back to table of contents, That Kuwaiti Event, According to an anonymous source and documents obtained by ThinkProgress, representatives from the Trump Organization pressured the ambassador of Kuwait to hold its embassy’s annual celebration of the country’s independence at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D. C. The event, held annually on February 25, was originally scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown the location was allegedly changed after members of the Trump Organization contacted the country’s ambassador. ThinkProgress’s source “described the decision as political,” suggesting that the embassy chose to relocate the event in an effort to curry favor with the  . The Kuwaiti ambassador has since disputed the report, telling The Washington Post that he had not been contacted by the Trump Organization and that the move “was solely done with the intention of providing our guests with a new venue. ” If ThinkProgress’s account is correct, Kuwait’s decision represents an escalation of a situation that has been developing since Trump’s election. The Trump International Hotel has been the subject of continual scrutiny for the conflict of interest it poses, in part because its lease explicitly bars elected officials from holding it, but mainly because Trump’s ownership of the hotel will almost definitely result in a violation of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from receiving payments from foreign powers —  something that will arguably be happening any time a foreign government books a room at the hotel. Already, the hotel has begun advertising itself as a destination for diplomats and dignitaries, and the embassies of Azerbaijan and Bahrain have both scheduled events in the building. However, before the ThinkProgress report, there was no evidence that the Trump Organization had individually reached out to a foreign government in hopes of getting it to relocate an event to the hotel. Back to table of contents, Those Certificates of Divestiture, In addition to the many possibilities for   Trump to pursue his financial interests in office, the unique makeup of his cabinet also creates a new set of financial motivations. While Trump’s own fortune automatically makes his administration the wealthiest in history, he has also surrounded himself with an unprecedented collection of billionaires and   whose investments are likely to also come under scrutiny. Unlike the   himself, those who are up for Trump’s cabinet, such as his proposed Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, will be legally obligated to divest from any holdings which may pose a conflict of interest. However, as The Washington Post noted, even selling off their holdings offers an opportunity for Trump’s cabinet members to enhance their fortunes. A federal program known as a “certificate of divestiture” allows   appointees and employees to avoid   taxes when selling their assets. The program has existed since 1989, and most recently received attention when President George W. Bush appointed Hank Paulson, then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as his Treasury Secretary in 2006. Paulson was forced to sell off $700 million in shares of the bank the certificate of divestiture enabled him to avoid a potential $200 million in   tax liability. According to The Washington Post, the Office of Government Ethics is currently researching whether the   himself would qualify for the tax break even if he doesn’t, the unprecedented wealth of Trump’s cabinet promises to push this provision, and the financial incentives it creates, to the limit. Back to table of contents, That Carrier Deal, One of   Donald Trump’s first major economic moves as   was the deal that he and Vice   Mike Pence struck with the   manufacturer Carrier, which had planned to move 2, 100 jobs from its Indiana plant to Mexico. Finalized on November 29, the compromise kept 730 of the plant’s jobs in Indiana in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years. The deal immediately attracted praise and criticism on both sides of the aisle, with much of the scrutiny going toward the tradeoff between jobs and tax breaks and Trump’s idiosyncratic,   negotiation techniques. An additional detail soon emerged regarding the deal: According to his FEC filings (which, despite Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller’s unverified statements that the   sold off his stock in June, remain the most recent public record of the  ’s finances) Trump holds stock in Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies. In 2014, his investment in the company was between $100, 001 and $250, 000, while in 2015, the stock is listed as worth less than $1, 001, which could indicate that he sold some or most of the stock each year, his holdings earned him between $2, 500 and $5, 000. The paucity of information in the FEC filings makes it difficult to ascertain why his holdings appear to have decreased regardless, the investment is not only one of several hundred but also a relatively minor one among Trump’s many holdings, some of which are worth over $5, 000, 000. As a result, it’s difficult to know how much, if at all, Trump may have considered the stock, particularly considering that he didn’t appear to remember his initial promise to save the Carrier plant. Additionally, Trump does not have stock in the next company he called out on Twitter, Rexnord Corporation (which is also based in Indiana) or its parent company, The Carlyle Group. Still, Trump’s deal with Carrier demonstrates the unprecedented challenge the  ’s conflicts of interest create: Unless he either puts his holdings in a truly blind trust or divests completely, a significant number of the decisions he makes will involve some level of financial incentive for himself as well as for the country. Back to table of contents, That   Issue, Over the past few months, a number of experts have called for   Donald Trump to either sell off his business holdings or, if the illiquidity of his assets prevents him from doing so, to put as much as possible into a blind trust managed by a lawyer or other trustee with whom he will have no contact. Pursuing one of these two options is seen by many as an important step to distancing himself from even the appearance that he will be considering his own financial prospects in addition to those of the nation while in office. In response, Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he intends to cede control of his business to his three adult children, Donald Jr. Ivanka, and Eric, although, as has been previously noted, doing so would barely even create the appearance of a blind trust given how his children are close advisers, members of his transition team, and, well, his children. (Trump has also alluded on Twitter to an upcoming press conference in which he intends to more fully explain his plans, although doubts remain that the arrangement he proposes will actually create the necessary barriers between Trump and his business.) Moreover, even if one does take take the   at his word that his children will be entirely separate from his administration, events since his election strongly suggest otherwise. All three have been seen in contexts that significantly diminish the appearance of separation Roughly two weeks before the election, Donald Jr. met with a   group in Paris to discuss his father’s policy toward Syria and, according to Politico, was involved in his father’s search for a Secretary of the Interior he was also spotted hunting in Turkey shortly after his father’s phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan in which the   praised a Turkish business partner. Eric, meanwhile, appeared in photos with his father and a group of Indian businessmen mere days after the election. Officials within the State Department have begun to express frustration with the optics of the Trump family’s current system. Much of the focus, though, has been on Ivanka, whom many consider to be among her father’s most trusted advisers, and the various ways she has indicated that she will remain a part of both the family business and her father’s administration. Ivanka also appeared in the photos with the family’s Indian business partners, and she and her husband Jared Kushner —  also one of Trump’s advisers —  sat in on a meeting between the   and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reports later emerged that, at the time, Ivanka was in negotiation with the Japanese apparel company Sanei International, whose parent company is owned in large part by the Japanese government. A number of outlets have reported that, while Melania Trump will be the official First Lady, Ivanka plans to assume a policy portfolio akin to that of previous first ladies one issue she apparently plans to take on is climate change, on which she recently met with her father and former Vice President Al Gore. Even the optics of physical distance are diminishing: According to CNN, Ivanka and Jared plan to move from New York to Washington, D. C. once the Trump administration begins. That the  ’s children appear involved in both the Trump administration and the Trump Organization presents a major threat to the   norm that presidents should distance themselves from business interests that could interfere with their official duties. Finally, removing himself from    operations will do little to change the fact that Trump will retain substantive knowledge of the illiquid assets involved in his business, such as the numerous buildings and other products that bear his name, especially if he remains in frequent contact with his children. Even assuming that Trump does separate himself from any consideration of his holdings, his children will still likely be major players in the family’s organization, which will still bear at least the Trump name —  arguably one of their most valuable properties, as much of the family’s wealth derives from licensing the name to   companies. Given the family’s     (Ivanka, for example, briefly appeared to be distancing herself from the campaign, and several properties considered rebranding under the name “Scion” when it appeared Trump would lose) the situation epitomizes the way Trump’s, and his family’s, business interests may very well prove inextricable from his actions as president. Back to table of contents, Those Fannie and Freddie Investments, After railing against elites during the campaign, Trump has so far stocked his prospective cabinet with an array of billionaires whose policy positions seem likely to significantly benefit those who are also doing very well. Trump’s putative treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is no exception: His resume includes stints as a banker at Goldman Sachs, a Hollywood producer, and the operator of a bank that has been described as a “foreclosure machine” and once foreclosed on a homeowner over a   discrepancy. One of Mnuchin’s apparent beliefs is that the government should cede control of the mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government acquired during the 2008 financial crisis. The two financial institutions’ stocks rose by more than 40 percent after Mnuchin stated that he believes the Trump administration “will get it done reasonably fast. ” Doing so would be broadly compatible with Trump’s general antipathy toward regulation of the banking industry. However, The Wall Street Journal identified an additional wrinkle to the story: When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s stocks rose, one major beneficiary was John Paulson, an adviser to the Trump campaign and a business partner of Mnuchin’s. Paulson’s hedge funds include significant investments in both Fannie and Freddie. Trump himself has invested between $3 million and $5 million across three of Paulson’s funds, according to his filings with the Federal Election Commission (which remain the only available window into the  ’s financial holdings). In other words, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s stock prices increase —  and they have so far more than doubled since the election on the expectation that the incoming Trump administration will be more lenient toward the financial sector than Obama —  Trump’s portfolio benefits. Back to table of contents, That Phone Call With Taiwan, When news first emerged that the   spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   on December 2, the immediate reaction was uproar over his apparently impetuous breach of decades of U. S. protocol toward China and Taiwan. As my colleague David Graham explained, since 1979, the United States has participated in the “artful diplomatic fiction” of officially recognizing the mainland People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate Chinese government while maintaining loose, unofficial recognition of —  and significant economic and military ties to —  Taiwan. That Trump would speak to the president of Taiwan, especially before doing the same with Xi Jinping, the president of the PRC, flies in the face of a diplomatic tradition that has undergirded almost 40 years of U. S.  relations. Amid the days of dissembling that followed the phone call, an additional worrisome detail came out: The Trump Organization has apparently been exploring expansion into Taiwan. Soon afterwards, the Trump Organization denied that it planned to do so however, even before the controversy arose, the mayor of Taoyuan, Taiwan, the municipality in which the Trump Organization allegedly wants to build, described in a televised interview a meeting with a representative of the Trump Organization in September to discuss prospective   projects, and at least one Trump employee was found to have posted on Facebook that she was in Taiwan at the time on a business trip. The phone call, and the many statements that have followed, are of particular interest because of the extent to which they dovetail with some of the biggest concerns about Trump’s approach toward governance. In the ensuing 48 hours, Republican officials offered several, sometimes entirely contradictory, explanations of what initially appeared to be an impulsive move by Trump depending on who was speaking, the phone call was actually initiated by   (which, if technically true, ignores that it was Trump’s staff who arranged the conversation) was just “a courtesy,” or manifested a policy shift weeks in the making —  although, regardless, it was made without first consulting the White House or State Department. The defense of the move, and the questions it creates regarding conflicts of interest, have largely hinged on the belief that, since voters apparently don’t mind, the reaction was overblown. On this issue, though, whether or not voters care is immaterial to the central question. The   of the United States breached decades of international protocol created to preserve a precarious balance of power. That decision raised not only the possibility that Trump was blundering into a potential international incident but also that he may have done so in part out of consideration for his business prospects. Back to table of contents, That Deutsche Bank Debt, Though he often brags about leveraging   law to become “The King of Debt,” Trump’s numerous bankruptcy filings have left most large Wall Street banks reticent to lend to him, according to The Wall Street Journal. Among the few exceptions is Deutsche Bank, which “has led or participated in loans of at least $2. 5 billion” to the   since 1996, with at least another $1 billion in loan commitments to   companies more than $300 million of those loans have come since 2012. The  ’s indebtedness does not itself pose a conflict of interest, but Deutsche Bank’s ongoing legal troubles very well might. The Justice Department is currently negotiating with Deutsche Bank regarding a preliminary settlement of $14 billion to resolve probes into allegedly misleading predatory lending practices in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis while it is believed that Deutsche Bank will push back against the sum, there has been no public news regarding negotiations since the initial figure was reported in September. Trump will soon be naming many of the officials with jurisdiction over this and other deals, prompting several House Democrats to send a letter to federal financial agencies calling for close scrutiny of how Trump may seek to influence the settlement through his appointments —  although doing so would be just as in keeping with his general stance toward financial regulation as with active protection of his pocketbook. Other Democrats have called for the proactive appointment of independent prosecutors to avoid any appearance of conflict if the case is not resolved before Trump takes office. Fears that Trump may unduly consider his indebtedness to Deutsche Bank in deciding his administration’s policy toward the financial sector go beyond general anxiety about deregulation. Deutsche Bank is undergoing a period of struggle that may have it on the verge of failure already. Its stock valuation has dropped by more than half since July 2015 in January, it posted its first   loss since 2008 and one of its many tranches of bonds —  one specifically designed to be a     safety valve in times of trouble —  has recently begun to crash. In June, the International Monetary Fund called Deutsche Bank “the most important net contributor to systemic risks” among globally important financial institutions. If the bank were to fail, it could have major consequences for not only Trump’s businesses, which would lose their sole remaining lender, but for the global economy as well. Arguably, the $14 billion fine the Justice Department is seeking to impose has exacerbated rather than alleviated these struggles. Based the company’s market capitalization —  the number of shares multiplied by their price —   of roughly $16 billion, the sum would leave Deutsche Bank critically low in liquid assets with which to absorb future troubles. although the institution’s own   of $68 billion argues otherwise. But given the complexity and potential volatility of the situation, it is important for any decision to be free from outside influence, something Trump’s outstanding debt threatens to jeopardize. Back to table of contents, That Secret Service Detail, During the election, the Trump campaign put no small portion of its funds toward paying for use of the candidate’s own properties perhaps the most notable of these expenditures was the nearly $170, 000 the campaign spent in July on rent for its headquarters in Trump Tower. These expenses raised the possibility that, as Trump predicted in 2000, he “could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it. ” Now that he will be president, he may be able to profit off of the Secret Service by virtue of the fact that he and his family will live in Trump Tower and fly in his private jets —  which requires the agents tasked with guarding them to pay him rent and airfare. The first way Trump could monetize his own protective detail is by having family members travel in his two planes and three helicopters. This is not so much speculative as foregone: Over the course of the campaign, the Secret Service, which traditionally pays for its own travel during elections, spent $2. 74 million to fly on a plane owned by one of Trump’s own companies. Once Trump takes office, he will fly exclusively on Air Force One, while Mike Pence will be riding Air Force Two. However, their families may still be flying on Trump’s private planes —  along with their protective details, which would effectively direct even more money to Trump. (Previous first families have flown with a detail, whose legal purview covers “the immediate family members,” but none have done so on planes they themselves own.) A bigger question regards Trump Tower in New York, where the   appears likely to spend a significant amount of time. For the past few decades, it has been common practice for the Secret Service to provide protection for the president and vice president’s   House residences, which sometimes entails paying rent to the officeholder. (Joe Biden, for example, received $2, 200 per month when the agency rented a cottage he owned near his home in Delaware.) But Trump Tower is a unique case, as it’s not in Delaware but the middle of Manhattan. Already, pedestrians and tourists are chafing at the increased security around the building, Trump’s frequent use of which has required closing a block of 56th Street and multiple lanes of Fifth Avenue with multiple outlets reporting that Trump’s wife Melania and    son Barron are expected to stay at Trump Tower for at least part of his term, it appears that the consternation will continue, with an enormous price tag for taxpayers: According to the New York Post, it could cost as much as $3 million a year to rent out two of the building’s vacant floors, meaning that Trump will be making money off of his own security detail. Meanwhile, Reuters has reported that the city of New York is calling for federal funds to reimburse the costs of keeping up a security detail around Trump Tower. This system creates an unusual set of conflicting interests for Trump regarding his own travel and residences. Though presidents as disparate as Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama have evoked partisan ire over time spent away from the White House, whether on the golf course or on vacation in Hawaii, only Donald Trump will actually have gained from his and his family’s travels. And if, while in office, Trump visits properties he owns other than Trump Tower —  his buildings in other U. S. cities like Chicago and Miami, for example, or his golf course and resort in Scotland, or one of the many international hotels bearing his name —  he stands to gain from the stays for which his security detail (and, by extension, taxpayers) may be paying. Moreover, the more his family members fly on his planes, whether they are running his business on his behalf or running interference with foreign leaders, the more the Secret Service will end up paying for seats alongside them. In fact, there are already signs that the Trump Organization has no qualms about making money off of the New York tower’s new security arrangements in more ways than one. According to Politico, just five days after the election, a prominent New York   firm invoked Trump Tower’s new   detail as a selling point for a $2. 1 million condominium, which it described as “The Best Value in the Most Secure Building in Manhattan. ” Though the flier was issued by an outside agency, the  ’s corporation still stands to benefit from increased traffic through processing and other service fees, making the advertisement a clear example of how Trump stands to benefit off of his new position. Back to table of contents, That Property in Georgia (the Country) Trump’s election has had the effect of speeding up development on a number of his branded properties, even when the   appears not to be pulling any strings himself. As occurred with Trump Tower Buenos Aires, the completion of an embattled   building in the former Soviet republic of Georgia is no longer on hold now that Trump has won. The project, which has been in the works in the seaside resort city of Batumi since 2010, was initially scheduled to break ground in 2013, but has been in stasis for several reasons, possibly including the 2013 electoral defeat of President Mikheil Saakashvili, a friend of Trump’s and a supporter of the deal. According to a report in The Washington Post, the   of the Trump property in Batumi has not been linked to a specific conversation with Georgian leaders, and a U. S.  partner on the project has suggested that it has moved forward without any nudging from the government. However, numerous public statements in the days since suggest that Trump’s election was a major factor, including an interview with a   entrepreneur who said, “Cutting the ribbon on a new Trump Tower in Georgia will be a symbol of victory for all of the free world. ” That the property seems to be moving forward solely because Trump was elected suggests his various business interests around the world may play a role not only in his foreign policy but in how other countries seek to deal with the U. S. as well. America’s relationship with Georgia is largely shaped by concerns about Russian influence and potential aggression in the region, most recently manifested in Russia’s 2008 seizure of two regions of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. With controversy already swirling over Trump’s admiration for Putin and Russia’s alleged role in the U. S. election, some in the   community have expressed trepidation that Trump’s potential deferential attitude toward Russia would prove deleterious for the continued independence of former satellite nations like Georgia. So, if Georgia has an ulterior motive behind the approval of Trump’s property in Batumi, it would be to keep Russia at bay and maintain the status quo in the region. It’s alarming that a country like Georgia may be giving Trump’s businesses favorable treatment (whether he asked for it or not) in an attempt to influence his foreign policy. Back to table of contents, That Phone Call With Erdogan, One of the worries regarding Trump’s many conflicts of interest is that they may influence policy towards countries whose relationships with the U. S. are currently strained. Such is the case with Turkey, whose president, Recep Erdogan, has been cracking down significantly on civil liberties and democratic institutions within the country after a failed coup last summer. Though Turkey has in the past been a vital U. S. ally as a bulwark against Islamic terror, Erdogan’s authoritarian turn and combative stance toward Europe have led to some reevaluation of that relationship. Thus, it was troubling news that when Erdogan phoned Trump earlier this month —  it was one of the first calls Trump received after his victory —  Trump used the opportunity to plug his business partners in Istanbul. According to the Huffington Post, while on the line with Erdogan, Trump relayed praise for the leader from Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, whose    Aydin Dogan, owns the holding company that operates the Trump Towers in Istanbul. Dogan has previously drawn Erdogan’s ire by criticizing the leader in recent years, however, Dogan’s companies, most notably CNN Turk, have shown support for Erdogan’s regime, including broadcasting his first message after the uprising in July. Trump’s conversation with Erdogan is also worth noting because of a number of Trump’s previous statements regarding the Turkish president. Though Erdogan briefly called for Trump’s name to be removed from the Istanbul property due to his proposed ban on Muslim immigration, Erdogan dropped the demand when, after the overthrow attempt, Trump praised Erdogan for “turning it around” and essentially dismissed concerns over Erdogan’s crackdown on civil liberties by bringing up domestic problems. Michael Flynn, who was recently named Trump’s national security adviser, wrote an     in The Hill arguing against offering asylum to a Muslim cleric whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating the uprising, which some have interpreted as a diplomatic overture. Erdogan has also bristled at   protests in the U. S. and the description of both himself and Trump as part of a “ring of autocrats. ” That the two are now talking about their countries’ relationship as in the same conversation as Trump’s business interests further complicates Trump’s strangely effusive comments about Erdogan. It’s worth noting that Trump himself considers his hotel in Istanbul a potential conflict of interest. In a December 2015 interview with Stephen Bannon, at the time the chairman of Breitbart News, Trump said as much, telling Bannon, “I have a little conflict of interest ‘cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul. It’s a tremendously successful job.” That he chose to discuss the towers with Erdogan, albeit obliquely, through his references to his business partners when he has already acknowledged the impropriety of doing so simply reinforces the perception that he may prove unable to separate his business from his official duties once he assumes office.   Back to table of contents,  That Hotel in Washington, D. C. The White House is not the only new Trump property in Washington, D. C. there’s also the new Trump International Hotel, which opened in October and is located just a few blocks away in what was formerly known as the Old Post Office Pavilion. Previously, the hotel played a role in the campaign as the site of the event at which Trump recanted (sort of) his belief that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Now, the hotel is at the center of speculation as a symbol of how inextricable Trump’s presidential role may be from his personal interests. First and foremost, Trump does not own the location outright instead, he leases the building from the federal government’s General Services Administration, an agency whose next administrator Trump will soon be appointing. The GSA has explicit regulations prohibiting contracts with government employees to prevent conflicts “that might arise between the employees’ interests and their Government duties, and to avoid the appearance of favoritism or preferential treatment. ” The Trump Organization’s   lease on the property likewise states, “no . .. elected official of the Government of the United States . .. shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom. ” According to House Democrats, the GSA has ruled that Trump “will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office” and must divest from the property before he does so. As if its location didn’t pose enough of an ethical question, the hotel has already hosted at least one promotional event specifically aimed at enticing foreign diplomats to stay at the establishment while in town on official state business. On the one hand, direct influence will likely be difficult to prove: The establishment is, after all, a   hotel that would have been likely to attract   clientele even if Trump had lost the election, a fact to which Trump and those who surround him may well point in order to maintain a patina of respectability around their dealings. Still, the meeting’s proximity to the election reinforces that it will be worth watching the comings and goings at the hotel closely for signs that Trump, who so often accused his opponent (often without evidence) of    may be using his position as president to promote his businesses. Trump himself acknowledged that his presidency is likely to increase traffic to his Washington, D. C. property. Speaking to The New York Times, the   noted that the property is “probably a more valuable asset than it was before” and that his brand is “hotter” since the election. However, he went on to insist that there was nothing even potentially problematic about his unprecedented situation and that he sees no reason why he couldn’t run both the presidency and his business without conflict. Multiple events since the election have made Trump’s lease on the hotel a central focus of discussions of his conflicts of interest, including among Democrats in the House. On November 29, Bahrain —  a country whose donations to the Clinton Foundation Trump and his campaign decried during the campaign —  announced that it would be celebrating the anniversary of its king’s ascension to the throne at the hotel. Other events announced since the election include a Hannukah celebration   by the Embassy of Azerbaijan and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and a reception for the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation featuring Vice   Mike Pence as its keynote speaker. Numerous ethics experts, many of whom are calling for Trump to generally divest his business holdings, have singled out the building’s lease, which will likely be breached the moment Trump takes office even if he does transfer his company to his children. And on November 30, mere hours after Trump stated on Twitter that “legal documents are being crafted which take [him] completely out of business operations,” Buzzfeed reported that Trump and the federal government were closing in on a tax subsidy for the property that could be worth as much as $32 million. As a result of the increasing scrutiny, the hotel and his handling of the commotion about it have become emblematic of the broader issues surrounding Trump’s conflicts of interest. Back to table of contents, That Argentinian Office Building, According to a report by the prominent Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata, the  ’s first phone call with his Argentine counterpart Mauricio Macri included a discussion of the permit issues currently holding up construction of a new   office building in Buenos Aires. Both Macri and Trump quickly denied the report according to a statement from the Embassy of Argentina, “The subject both leaders talked about was the institutional relationship, and they briefly mentioned the personal relationship they have had for years. ” As summarized in a tweetstorm here, Trump’s relationship with Argentina’s government and business elites —  and the story so far on his property there —  is already long and convoluted. The phone call with Macri was apparently set up through Felipe Yaryura, one of Trump’s longtime associates whose company, YY Development Group, is in charge of Trump Tower Buenos Aires. The day after the phone call, the PanAm Post reported that YY Development Group had been approved to break ground in June 2017 evidence has since emerged that the permitting process is not, in fact, finished, although Trump’s business associates are moving ahead as though it is. Back to table of contents, Those Companies in Saudi Arabia, Even as Trump was running for president, his company was continuing to operate and open new properties. While the most memorable openings may have been that of his hotel in Washington, D. C. and his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, the Trump Organization was continuing to work on projects in other countries, including, according to a report the Washington Post, registering eight new companies in Saudi Arabia during the   campaign. The organization’s endeavors in Saudi Arabia are notable not only because they may further complicate the shaky relationship between the U. S. and an   gulf state notorious for   abuses but also because of how they relate to Trump’s campaign rhetoric. One of his criticisms of Hillary Clinton was that her charitable foundation had accepted donations from governments with questionable records on human rights, most notably Qatar and Saudi Arabia, always with the implication (or direct accusation) that they were doing so to curry favor with Clinton when she was secretary of state. That Trump was continuing to level this criticism while his namesake organization was actively pursuing new projects in Saudi Arabia not only bodes ill for his ability to separate his personal and presidential interests but also further calls into question the honesty and transparency of his campaign. Back to table of contents, That British Wind Farm, As he indicated when he stopped there during the campaign,   Trump takes enormous pride in his recently opened golf course in Turnberry, Scotland. The day after the British public voted for Brexit —  over intense Scottish opposition —  Trump spoke at the property’s opening, proudly touting how the decision’s deflationary effect on the pound would benefit his business. However, Trump also has a second golf course in Aberdeen, where it appears Trump has attempted to intercede in the interest of his own pocketbook.* According to The New York Times, Trump had a   meeting with Nigel Farage in which he “encouraged Mr. Farage and his entourage to oppose the kind of offshore wind farms that Mr. Trump believes will mar the pristine view from one of his two Scottish golf courses. ” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the   denied that the two had discussed the subject, only for Trump to later confirm that the topic had, in fact, come up in their conversation. * This entry originally misstated that Trump intervened at Turnberry, his other golf course in Scotland. We regret the error.   Back to table of contents, Those Indian Business Partners, It didn’t take long after the election for   Trump to be seen in public with international business partners. According to a November 19 article in The New York Times, Trump took a break from his transition schedule to meet with three Indian   executives who are currently building a   apartment complex in Mumbai. According to both Trump and the Indian businessmen, the meeting was essentially congratulatory in nature a picture posted by one of the executives on Twitter shows the four men smiling broadly and giving a   to the camera. However, that the meeting happened in the first place suggests that Trump does not currently have any qualms about forestalling official state business for personal business. On top of that, the meeting raises questions in the   realm as well. The   himself was not the only member of his family there two Facebook photos show that Ivanka and Eric Trump both attended the meeting as well. Their presence serves as a reminder that their father seems so far uninterested in maintaining even the nominal separation between himself and his assets that he repeatedly said he would create during the campaign. Back to table of contents, That Envoy From the Philippines, One leader with whom Trump already has an advantage over President Obama is Rodrigo Duterte, the similarly brash president of the Philippines. Duterte, who has threatened to “break up with America,” told Obama to “go to hell,” and called the president a “son of a whore,” expressed admiration for Trump, noting that, among other similarities, they both enjoy swearing. Duterte’s affinity for Trump apparently goes beyond vulgar word choice. Late in October, Duterte appointed a longtime business associate of Trump’s as a special envoy to the United States, an announcement that became public shortly after the election. This appointment in particular raises questions because it is just as open to exploitation by Duterte as it is to Trump, as the Filipino president could intend to use his new envoy’s relationship with Trump to strengthen the Philippines’ hand. Whichever side the appointment does eventually benefit, however, the situation is nevertheless fraught with conflicts between the three men’s personal and political interests.

53290,73468,Dozens of For-Profit Colleges Could Soon Close ,Atlantic,Emily DeRuy,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"Dozens of   colleges could be forced to close in the next several years. This week, the Obama administration published a list of schools and programs that are at risk of losing access to the federal loans many of them depend on to survive. More than 800 vocational programs the department reviewed (at   schools, private nonprofit schools, and public community colleges) failed to show that their graduates were able to find decent jobs, meaning the former students have annual loan payments that are more than 30 percent of their discretionary income and more than 12 percent of their total earnings. Not insignificantly, virtually all —  98 percent —  of the programs that do not meet that bar are   schools. Not a single community college appears on the list. If schools that have been flagged by the government don’t begin to turn things around within several years, they stand to lose aid, and, in many cases, would likely shutter as a result. And now, in what one of the authors says is coincidental timing, a new study paints a picture of where the students who are affected by the closure of   schools might go by examining how a similar period of increased regulation of the industry played out in the past. In an NBER working paper entitled “Where Do Students Go When   Colleges Lose Federal Aid? ,” the researchers Stephanie Cellini, Rajeev Darolia, and Lesley Turner (professors who study public policy and economics at George Washington University, the University of Missouri, and the University of Maryland, respectively) looked at students who attended   colleges in the 1990s. Back in the ‘80s, the number of   schools was expanding and the government created a rule aimed at sanctioning schools where a lot of former students defaulted on their federal loans. It was a scenario not unlike today. More than 1, 200   faced sanctions in the ‘90s, according to the researchers. The researchers found that when schools were threatened with the loss of access to federal aid, the percentage of Pell grant recipients (  students who depend on federal grants and loans to pay for their higher education) who enrolled declined by about 53 percent in the following five years. Interestingly, enrollment at neighboring   schools also fell, even if they weren’t sanctioned, perhaps because the reputation of the entire sector was damaged by the sanctions. That might sound dire but it turns out these students weren’t dropping out of college completely. The researchers found that the   declines in enrollment at   colleges didn’t actually reduce aggregate educational attainment. In other words, the students enrolled in community colleges within the county. And with community colleges costing a fraction of what     colleges cost, federal   borrowing and default rates also declined. In fact, the researchers estimate that 70 percent of the students who stopped borrowing because they switched to a different school would have defaulted on their loans had they remained at the   colleges. This would seem to push back at the idea, put forth by the   industry, that the rules around how and which schools gain access to aid hinder student achievement. A disproportionate percentage of   veteran, and minority students enroll in   colleges, and the industry has long argued that constricting its reach would harm these students. Yet the new data released by the administration and this working paper seem to suggest that these students, on the whole, fare okay when such regulations exist, particularly when they have a chance to enroll in schools that are less expensive and have the same (and in many cases better) employment outcomes. It’s important to point out that it’s still too soon to know how students who attend the   schools will fare. But it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect to see similar patterns take shape in the coming years. Right now,   can get up to 90 percent of their revenue from federal aid, and the working paper cites studies that have shown that when the schools have access to federal aid, they charge significantly more than similar programs without access to aid. Likewise, when the amount of money the government puts toward Pell grants rises, researchers have found an uptick in the number of   colleges opening, particularly in areas with lots of   students who have access to those grants. But just as sanctions in the ‘90s had an effect on the   industry’s reach, the Education Department estimates that there are fewer than 29, 000 vocational programs subject to the regulation today, down from more than 37, 000 in 2014. For instance, the   giants ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges shuttered their campuses after the Obama administration slapped them with federal sanctions. And last month, the agency that accredited the schools also lost its recognition from the Education Department as a valid accreditor, meaning the other schools it authorized will need to find a new agency to avoid losing their federal aid. Still, it’s also worth noting that there are some variables today that could ultimately make the landscape look very different than it did in the ‘90s. The Missing Piece in the Debate Over College Costs  For one thing, Donald Trump is about to be president, and he and the people he’s tapped to lead his administration have pushed back at what they view as cumbersome federal overreach. The administration could try to repeal the rule, or it could simply fail to enforce it. During a call with reporters this week to discuss the new data, U. S. Education Secretary John King declined to speculate on how Trump’s team might handle the regulation, but acknowledged that the next administration could choose to “revisit” the regulatory process. That’s clearly something   investors are banking on after Trump’s election several   colleges saw their stock prices rise. Secondly, the community colleges that former   students were able to enroll in back in the ‘90s were frequently less crowded and less   then. Today, some community colleges have interest from more students than they are equipped to handle, and a number of states have rolled back funding for public education. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, funding for   and   colleges is almost $10 billion lower than it was before the recession. The researchers acknowledge this, but their suggestion that states would be wise to increase funding for community colleges during periods of heavy regulation is perhaps unrealistically optimistic. (Stephanie Cellini, a professor at George Washington University and one of the authors of the paper, suggested during a phone interview that the possibility —  largely absent in the ‘90s —  for colleges to deliver education online might limit some of the potential for issues around capacity.) Ultimately, it’s too early to tell what the   sector will look like in the coming years. And the new data suggests there is real reason to be cautious about enrolling in a number of   schools. But Secretary King also said during the call that higher education is still a wise investment. It’s just important to understand which programs are worth the money, and which are, as he put it, a “liability. ”"
53291,73469,The Milky Way’s Stolen Stars,Atlantic,Marina Koren,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"The force of gravity can be described using a number of metaphors: It’s the glue that holds solar systems and galaxies together, the anchor that keeps us on the ground, the slingshot that sends spacecraft deeper into the solar system. And in some cases, gravity is a thief. Astronomers at the   Center for Astrophysics said Wednesday they have discovered that some of the most distant stars in the Milky Way galaxy actually came the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, one of the dozens of smaller galaxies surrounding ours. When Sagittarius passed by, the Milky Way’s gravitational tides pulled on the galaxy, and made off with five stars. The five interlopers are among the farthest known stars in the Milky Way, located in a stretch of stars outside the galaxy’s spiral disk. Astronomers determined their origin using computer simulations. They simulated the movements of the Sagittarius and Milky Way galaxies over the course of 8 billion years. The test showed that over time, Sagittarius lost about   of its stars. The stars, the scientists say, were whisked away by the Milky Way and settled into streams at the galaxy’s edge. The observed position and velocities of the stolen stars also suggests they came from Sagittarius, they say. This kind of cosmic theft may be common in the universe, particularly in neighborhoods of closely orbiting galaxies. In 2011, scientists using a   telescope in Chile to study the Large Magellanic Cloud, another satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, discovered that more than 5 percent of the stars inside the cloud were spinning in the wrong direction. What’s more, their chemical composition, particularly the ratios of elements like iron and calcium, didn’t match that of other stars inside the cloud. Instead, they looked a lot like stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, its sister galaxy. The stars inside the larger galaxy, they concluded, must have been torn away, thanks to gravitational tides. Galaxies were once considered “island universes,” but maybe, just like humans, “no galaxy is an island” after all."

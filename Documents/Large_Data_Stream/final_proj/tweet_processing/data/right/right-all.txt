Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of Apple . We will be talking about many things , including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years , by many countries , on trade .
. @ FLOTUS did a spectacular job hosting the President of France @ EmmanuelMacron and his wife Brigitte . Every detail was done to perfection . The State Dining Room never looked more beautiful , and Washington is abuzz over what an incredible job Melania did .
Busy day planned . Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today . This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done ... he will be GREAT !
Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat . Debbie will do a Great Job ! Press is so silent .

Here ‚Äô s a great stat - since January 2017 , the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million . The American people are finally back to work !
Mexico , whose laws on immigration are very tough , must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement . Our Country can not accept what is happening ! Also , we must get Wall funding fast .
Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided , I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country . It is a disgrace . We are the only Country in the World so naive ! WALL
Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State . The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people , including the Ambassador to Germany . They are maxing out the time on approval process for all , never happened before . Need more Republicans !
Thank you to the incredible Law Enforcement Officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff ‚Äô s Office . They keep us safe and are very cool about it ! https : //t.co/NlhxpPwmzT
Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said , after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos , ‚Äú you got to ask , what was the purpose of the Special Counsel ? There ‚Äô s no there there. ‚Äù Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought !
Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn ‚Äô t come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal !
A complete Witch Hunt !
‚Äú I can die happy now with Trump Job performance , ‚Äù stated Mary Matalin . ‚Äú A great overall President , stunning ! ‚Äù Thank you Mary .
... .We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea , maybe things will work out , and maybe they won ‚Äô t - only time will tell ... .But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago !
Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea , and they have given up nothing . Wow , we haven ‚Äô t given up anything & amp ; they have agreed to denuclearization ( so great for World ) , site closure , & amp ; no more testing !
‚Äú GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton. ‚Äù @ FoxNews Good luck with that request !

The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as ‚Äú Mr . Magoo ‚Äù and Rod Rosenstein as ‚Äú Mr . Peepers. ‚Äù This is ‚Äú according to people with whom the president has spoken. ‚Äù There are no such people and don ‚Äô t know these characters ... just more Fake & amp ; Disgusting News to create ill will !
James Comey ‚Äô s Memos are Classified , I did not Declassify them . They belong to our Government ! Therefore , he broke the law ! Additionally , he totally made up many of the things he said I said , and he is already a proven liar and leaker . Where are Memos on Clinton , Lynch & amp ; others ?
Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson . His trials and tribulations were great , his life complex and controversial . Others have looked at this over the years , most thought it would be done , but yes , I am considering a Full Pardon !
So funny , the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning . Now he R ‚Äô s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material , including Servers and Emails !
Heading to the Southern White House to watch the Funeral Service of Barbara Bush . First Lady Melania has arrived in Houston to pay our respects . Will be a beautiful day !

The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman , known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don ‚Äô t speak to and have nothing to do with , are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will ‚Äú flip. ‚Äù They use ... .
A message from Kim Jong Un : ‚Äú North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles . ‚Äù
Also will ‚Äú Shut down a nuclear test site in the country ‚Äô s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests. ‚Äù Progress being made for all !
James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council ? Therefore , the Special Council was established based on an illegal act ? Really , does everybody know what that means ?
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats . This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI , the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails .
North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site . This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress ! Look forward to our Summit .
Can you believe that despite 93 % bad stories from the Fake News Media ( should be getting good stories ) , today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers , including those on Election Day ? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press . Make America Great Again !
Looks like OPEC is at it again . With record amounts of Oil all over the place , including the fully loaded ships at sea , Oil prices are artificially Very High ! No good and will not be accepted !
Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans ... got not one Democrat Vote ! Here ‚Äô s a choice . They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially . Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts !
So exciting ! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis , Maryland . Looking forward to being there .
So General Michael Flynn ‚Äô s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book ( that should never have been written ) . Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work ? I don ‚Äô t think so !
James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION . Also , he leaked classified information . WOW ! Will the Witch Hunt continue ?
James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe ‚Äú under the bus. ‚Äù Inspector General ‚Äô s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them ! Getting a little ( lot ) of their own medicine ?
Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States , making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed . We are doing a great job of law enforcement , but things such as this make safety in America difficult !
My thoughts , prayers and condolences are with the families , friends and colleagues of the two @ GCSOFlorida deputies ( HEROES ) who lost their lives in the line of duty today .
Mike Pompeo is outstanding . First in his class at West Point . A top student at Harvard Law School . A success at whatever he has done . We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP . He will be a great Secretary of State !
... Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors , Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved . The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country !
Democrats are obstructing good ( hopefully great ) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government , hence , the American People . They are ‚Äú slow walking ‚Äù all of my nominations - hundreds of people . At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals !
. @ MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her . Great on the Military , Border Security and Crime . Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee . She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her !
THANK YOU # JIATFSouth , @ Norad_Northcom , @ southcomwatch and @ DHSgov . Keep up the GREAT work ! https : //t.co/3v2uG6Jp1T

Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy ‚Äú up to 400 National Guard Troops ‚Äù to do nothing . The crime rate in California is high enough , and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown ‚Äô s charade . We need border security and action , not words !
Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California 's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary ' policies . California 's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities , putting all Americans at risk .

Slippery James Comey , the worst FBI Director in history , was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where , by the way , there was NO COLLUSION ( except by the Dems ) !
Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week . Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed . Details of Summit are being worked out now . Denuclearization will be a great thing for World , but also for North Korea !

Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates . Not acceptable !
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her ( lied in Congress to Senator G ) , then based his decisions on her poll numbers . Disgruntled , he , McCabe , and the others , committed many crimes !
Just hit 50 % in the Rasmussen Poll , much higher than President Obama at same point . With all of the phony stories and Fake News , it ‚Äô s hard to believe ! Thank you America , we are doing Great Things .
Slippery James Comey , a man who always ends up badly and out of whack ( he is not smart ! ) , will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history , by far !
Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past . I have many ( too many ! ) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices , and even homes , are going to be raided with everything , including their phones and computers , taken . All lawyers are deflated and concerned !
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty . I hardly even knew this guy . Just another of his many lies . His ‚Äú memos ‚Äù are self serving and FAKE !
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out , with such precision , that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term ‚Äú Mission Accomplished. ‚Äù I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term , it should be brought back . Use often !
Comey throws AG Lynch ‚Äú under the bus ! ‚Äù Why can ‚Äô t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch ? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat , or AG , in order to lay off Hillary . No golf and grandkids talk ( give us all a break ) !
The big questions in Comey ‚Äô s badly reviewed book aren ‚Äô t answered like , how come he gave up Classified Information ( jail ) , why did he lie to Congress ( jail ) , why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI ( why didn ‚Äô t they TAKE it ) , why the phony memos , McCabe ‚Äô s $ 700,000 & amp ; more ?
Unbelievably , James Comey states that Polls , where Crooked Hillary was leading , were a factor in the handling ( stupidly ) of the Clinton Email probe . In other words , he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win , and he wanted a job . Slimeball !

James Comey is a proven LEAKER & amp ; LIAR . Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was , in fact , fired . He leaked CLASSIFIED information , for which he should be prosecuted . He lied to Congress under OATH . He is a weak and ... ..
Tremendous pressure is building , like never before , for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities . Started the Wall in San Diego , where the people were pushing really hard to get it . They will soon be protected !

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & amp ; Corrupt Russia Investigation , headed up by the all Democrat loyalists , or people that worked for Obama . Mueller is most conflicted of all ( except Rosenstein who signed FISA & amp ; Comey letter ) . No Collusion , so they go crazy !
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been , and that includes the Cold War . There is no reason for this . Russia needs us to help with their economy , something that would be very easy to do , and we need all nations to work together . Stop the arms race ?

Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse , FBI , Comey , Lynch , McCabe , Clinton Emails and much more . Slow walking - what is going on ? BAD !
We are sealing up our Southern Border . The people of our great country want Safety and Security . The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue !
The United States hasn ‚Äô t had a Trade Surplus with China in 40 years . They must end unfair trade , take down barriers and charge only Reciprocal Tariffs . The U.S. is losing $ 500 Billion a year , and has been losing Billions of Dollars for decades . Can not continue !

Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A.G. Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt , who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege ? Do people really believe this stuff ? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt !
China , which is a great economic power , is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization . They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages , especially over the U.S . Does anybody think this is fair . We were badly represented . The WTO is unfair to U.S .

I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy . Amazon should pay these costs ( plus ) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer . Many billions of dollars . P.O . leaders don ‚Äô t have a clue ( or do they ? ) !
Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling . Just hit 50 % , which is higher than Cheatin ‚Äô Obama at the same time in his Administration .
Check out the fact that you can ‚Äô t get a job at ratings challenged @ CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump ? Little Jeff Zuker , whose job is in jeopardy , is not having much fun lately . They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting !
The big Caravan of People from Honduras , now coming across Mexico and heading to our ‚Äú Weak Laws ‚Äù Border , had better be stopped before it gets there . Cash cow NAFTA is in play , as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen . Congress MUST ACT NOW !
The Fake News Networks , those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA , are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast . The ‚Äú Fakers ‚Äù at CNN , NBC , ABC & amp ; CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction !

Honduras , Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to , sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES . Caravans are heading here . Must pass tough laws and build the WALL . Democrats allow open borders , drugs and crime !
As ridiculous as it sounds , the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from . A whole big wasted procedure must take place . Mexico & amp ; Canada have tough immigration laws , whereas ours are an Obama joke . ACT CONGRESS

So sad that the Department of ‚Äú Justice ‚Äù and the FBI are slow walking , or even not giving , the unredacted documents requested by Congress . An embarrassment to our country !
Only fools , or worse , are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon . THEY LOSE A FORTUNE , and this will be changed . Also , our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country ... not a level playing field !
So funny to watch Fake News Networks , among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with , criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased . Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC , which is a total joke .
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA ... They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic . With all of the money they make from the U.S. , hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours , at least until Congress changes our immigration laws !
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn ‚Äô t care or act , and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon ... No longer works . Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation . Democrats want No Borders , hence drugs and crime !
... Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation , use Nuclear Option if necessary , to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People . Border Patrol Agents ( and ICE ) are GREAT , but the weak Dem laws don ‚Äô t allow them to do their job . Act now Congress , our country is being stolen !
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ‚Äú Caravans ‚Äù of people enter their country . They must stop them at their Northern Border , which they can do because their border laws work , not allow them to pass through into our country , which has no effective border laws ... ..
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA . They want in on the act !
Mexico is doing very little , if not NOTHING , at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border , and then into the U.S . They laugh at our dumb immigration laws . They must stop the big drug and people flows , or I will stop their cash cow , NAFTA . NEED WALL !
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal ( Democrat ) laws like Catch & amp ; Release . Getting more dangerous . ‚Äú Caravans ‚Äù coming . Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW . NO MORE DACA DEAL !

I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats ( not even mentioned in Bill ) and the BORDER WALL , which is desperately needed for our National Defense , is not fully funded .
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats . Very unfair to them ! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall .

Remember when they were saying , during the campaign , that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds , but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary ‚Äô s large and highly sophisticated staff . Well , not saying that anymore !
Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy . Actually , he is weak , both mentally and physically , and yet he threatens me , for the second time , with physical assault . He doesn ‚Äô t know me , but he would go down fast and hard , crying all the way . Don ‚Äô t threaten people Joe !
Democrats refused to take care of DACA . Would have been so easy , but they just didn ‚Äô t care . I had to fight for Military and start of Wall .
Got $ 1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border , rest will be forthcoming . Most importantly , got $ 700 Billion to rebuild our Military , $ 716 Billion next year ... most ever . Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment .

Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe , but he never took notes when he was with me . I don ‚Äô t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda , probably at a later date . Same with lying James Comey . Can we call them Fake Memos ?
Wow , watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‚Äú have you ever been an anonymous source ... or known someone else to be an anonymous source ... ? ‚Äù He said strongly ‚Äú never , no. ‚Äù He lied as shown clearly on @ foxandfriends .
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime . It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC , and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign . WITCH HUNT !
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught , called out and fired . How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife ‚Äô s campaign by Crooked H friend , Terry M , who was also under investigation ? How many lies ? How many leaks ? Comey knew it all , and much more !
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded , there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign . As many are now finding out , however , there was tremendous leaking , lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI , Justice & amp ; State . # DrainTheSwamp

We are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in Yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our Veterans .
The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be , if completed , a very good one for the World . Time and place to be determined .
Spoke to PM @ TurnbullMalcolm of Australia . He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship . Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don ‚Äô t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally , the great nation of Australia !
That ‚Äô s right @ RepBost ! Thank you for your support in helping put America back to work . It ‚Äô s about JOBS , JOBS , JOBS for our incredible workers and putting AMERICA FIRST ! https : //t.co/ChUQEa6rsC

Looking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House . We have to protect & amp ; build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military .
The U.S. is acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft . We can not allow this to happen as it has for many years !
China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States . Our relationship with China has been a very good one , and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with . We must act soon !
From Bush 1 to present , our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories , 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars . Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars . Bad Policies & amp ; Leadership . Must WIN again ! # MAGA

Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea . For the first time in many years , a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned . The World is watching and waiting ! May be false hope , but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction !
Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that ‚Äú President Trump has the right to end DACA. ‚Äù President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem , and didn ‚Äô t . I am waiting for the Dems , they are running for the hills !

Total inaction on DACA by Dems . Where are you ? A deal can be made !
The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House . Wrong ! People will always come & amp ; go , and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision . I still have some people that I want to change ( always seeking perfection ) . There is no Chaos , only great Energy !
It ‚Äô s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA . Gave them 6 months , they just don ‚Äô t care . Where are they ? We are ready to make a deal !
Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign ( with zero proof of wrongdoing ) long before the Election in November ? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win . Unprecedented . Bigger than Watergate ! Plus , Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling .
To protect our Country we must protect American Steel ! # AMERICA FIRST
... treat our farmers much better . Highly restrictive . Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S . They have not done what needs to be done . Millions of people addicted and dying .
We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada . NAFTA , which is under renegotiation right now , has been a bad deal for U.S.A . Massive relocation of companies & amp ; jobs . Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & amp ; fair NAFTA agreement is signed . Also , Canada must..
We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals . Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years . Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead . Sorry , it ‚Äô s time for a change ! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun . I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something , and especially since this is for the American People !
If the E.U . wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there , we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S . They make it impossible for our cars ( and more ) to sell there . Big trade imbalance !
The United States has an $ 800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our ‚Äú very stupid ‚Äù trade deals and policies . Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years . They laugh at what fools our leaders have been . No more !

We must protect our country and our workers . Our steel industry is in bad shape . IF YOU DON ‚Äô T HAVE STEEL , YOU DON ‚Äô T HAVE A COUNTRY !

I never said ‚Äú give teachers guns ‚Äù like was stated on Fake News @ CNN & amp ; @ NBC . What I said was to look at the possibility of giving ‚Äú concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best . 20 % of teachers , a lot , would now be able to

‚Äú There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America ‚Äô s elections , there ‚Äô s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time , and so I ‚Äô d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes. ‚Äù ... ..

Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election , he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats , lead by their fearless leader , Crooked Hillary Clinton , lost the 2016 election . But wasn ‚Äô t I a great candidate ?
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election , I said ‚Äú it may be Russia , or China or another country or group , or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer. ‚Äù The Russian ‚Äú hoax ‚Äù was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did !
Finally , Liddle ‚Äô Adam Schiff , the leakin ‚Äô monster of no control , is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election . He is finally right about something . Obama was President , knew of the threat , and did nothing . Thank you Adam !
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $ 1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress , the FBI or Justice called for an investigation !
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H , the DNC and the Dems . Remember the Dirty Dossier , Uranium , Speeches , Emails and the Podesta Company !
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter . This is not acceptable . They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion . Get back to the basics and make us all proud !
Just like they don ‚Äô t want to solve the DACA problem , why didn ‚Äô t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & amp ; Senate during the Obama Administration . Because they didn ‚Äô t want to , and now they just talk !

So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed , even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior . Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem . Must always report such instances to authorities , again and again !

Today , I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate , as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America ‚Äô s depleted infrastructure . https : //t.co/8ByoQJsjTT https : //t.co/BVBRDvHfcC

Negotiations on DACA have begun . Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal . Wouldn ‚Äô t it be great if we could finally , after so many years , solve the DACA puzzle . This will be our last chance , there will never be another opportunity ! March 5th .
Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except , of course , the Democrats . After many years we have taken care of our Military , now we have to fix our roads , bridges , tunnels , airports and more . Bipartisan , make deal Dems ?
The journey to # MAGA began @ CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year . See you at # CPAC2018 !
Thank you to Sue Kruczek , who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge , for your kind words while on @ foxandfriends . We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain !
This will be a big week for Infrastructure . After so stupidly spending $ 7 trillion in the Middle East , it is now time to start investing in OUR Country !
Just spoke to @ JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @ WestervillePD . This is a true tragedy !
Rep. Lou Barletta , a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters , will make a FANTASTIC Senator . He is strong & amp ; smart , loves Pennsylvania & amp ; loves our Country ! Voted for Tax Cuts , unlike Bob Casey , who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer !
4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut & amp ; Jobs Bill ... .and it will only get better ! We are far ahead of schedule .
So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn ‚Äô t want to go there . Same negative stories over and over again ! No wonder the People no longer trust the media , whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history ! # MAGA
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe , modern and lawful immigration system : fully securing the border , ending chain migration , and canceling the visa lottery . Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans . https : //t.co/xV1lgfhjBU
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers , their families , and everybody at the @ WestervillePD . https : //t.co/AoingY77Ky
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do . The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 , and they decided not to do anything about DACA . They only want to use it as a campaign issue . Vote Republican !
... .agencies , not just the FBI & amp ; DOJ , now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election . Comey had conversations with Donald Trump , which I don ‚Äô t believe were accurate ... he leaked information ( corrupt ) . ‚Äù Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @ FoxNews
‚Äú My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier , it shows that he ‚Äô s been victimized . He ‚Äô s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of ... ... .
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation . Some are true and some are false . Some are old and some are new . There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone . Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process ?
According to the @ nytimes , a Russian sold phony secrets on ‚Äú Trump ‚Äù to the U.S . Asking price was $ 10 million , brought down to $ 1 million to be paid over time . I hope people are now seeing & amp ; understanding what is going on here . It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP !
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew , because of sources and methods ( and more ) , would have to be heavily redacted , whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency . Told them to re-do and send back in proper form !
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low !
Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election , and beyond . This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military , but much waste in order to get Dem votes . Fortunately , DACA not included in this Bill , negotiations to start now !
Without more Republicans in Congress , we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally , after many years of depletion , take care of our Military . Sadly , we needed some Dem votes for passage . Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election !
Just signed Bill . Our Military will now be stronger than ever before . We love and need our Military and gave them everything ‚Äî and more . First time this has happened in a long time . Also means JOBS , JOBS , JOBS !
Wow ! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch . Warner did not want a ‚Äú paper trail ‚Äù on a ‚Äú private ‚Äù meeting ( in London ) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame . All tied into Crooked Hillary .

We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system . Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security . https : //t.co/rP9Gtr2E5N
Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA , fully secures the border , ends chain migration & amp ; cancels the visa lottery . If D ‚Äô s oppose this deal , they aren ‚Äô t serious about DACA-they just want open borders . https : //t.co/XDMcDOr9vM
My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson , a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken . @ Colts
So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @ Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson . This is just one of many such preventable tragedies . We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border , and with illegal immigration , FAST !
Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law , your paychecks are going way UP , your taxes are going way DOWN , and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS ! https : //t.co/GISFbDDGXX
Representative Devin Nunes , a man of tremendous courage and grit , may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure !
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time . March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA . Make a deal !
Little Adam Schiff , who is desperate to run for higher office , is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington , right up there with Comey , Warner , Brennan and Clapper ! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information . Must be stopped !
Thank you to @ foxandfriends for exposing the truth . Perhaps that ‚Äô s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition !
The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working . Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care . No thanks !

... a tool of anti-Trump political actors . This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law ... .The FBI wasn ‚Äô t straight with Congress , as it hid most of these facts from investigators. ‚Äù Wall Street Journal
‚Äú The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath ... .The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier ... .the FBI became ... .
Great jobs numbers and finally , after many years , rising wages- and nobody even talks about them . Only Russia , Russia , Russia , despite the fact that , after a year of looking , there is No Collusion !
This memo totally vindicates ‚Äú Trump ‚Äù in probe . But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on . Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction ( the word now used because , after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING , collusion is dead ) . This is an American disgrace !
Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49 % , a far better number than I had in winning the Election , and higher than certain ‚Äú sacred cows. ‚Äù Other Trump polls are way up also . So why does the media refuse to write this ? Oh well , someday !

The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago . Rank & amp ; File are great people !

Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech . 45.6 million people watched , the highest number in history . @ FoxNews beat every other Network , for the first time ever , with 11.7 million people tuning in . Delivered from the heart !
March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA . They Resist , Blame , Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing . Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix , NOW !

I have offered DACA a wonderful deal , including a doubling in the number of recipients & amp ; a twelve year pathway to citizenship , for two reasons : ( 1 ) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem . ( 2 ) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA , only use it !

For those asking , the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate , and they need 60 . That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election ! We can then be even tougher on Crime ( and Border ) , and even better to our Military & amp ; Veterans !
This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present . # DemocratShutdown

The Wall is the Wall , it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it . Parts will be , of necessity , see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains , wastelands or tough rivers or water ... ..
ISIS is in retreat , our economy is booming , investments and jobs are pouring back into the country , and so much more ! Together there is nothing we can ‚Äô t overcome -- even a very biased media . We ARE Making America Great Again !

I don ‚Äô t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA . They are all talk and no action . This is the time but , day by day , they are blowing the one great opportunity they have . Too bad !

The Democrats are all talk and no action . They are doing nothing to fix DACA . Great opportunity missed . Too bad !

Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is , obviously , a very poor and troubled country . Never said ‚Äú take them out. ‚Äù Made up by Dems . I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians . Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately , no trust !
Sadly , Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal , not a fair deal , for DACA . Take care of our Military , and our Country , FIRST !
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough , but this was not the language used . What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA !
... .Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety , DACA has now taken a big step backwards . The Dems will threaten ‚Äú shutdown , ‚Äù but what they are really doing is shutting down our military , at a time we need it most . Get smart , MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !

The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border , risking thousands of lives in the process . It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans . We must build a Great Wall , think Merit and end Lottery & amp ; Chain . USA !
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization . Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal . She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first !
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan , reversing a years long opposite trend . Thank you Chrysler , a very wise decision . The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence . Plenty of more to follow !

The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues . There was no collusion , everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion , & amp ; yet on and on it goes . Russia & amp ; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing . Republicans should finally take control !
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein , who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found , would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way , totally without authorization , is a disgrace . Must have tough Primary !
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case ( such as DACA ) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts .

Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration . Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky !
I ‚Äô ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President . Now I have to put up with a Fake Book , written by a totally discredited author . Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well . So will I !

Now that Russian collusion , after one year of intense study , has proven to be a total hoax on the American public , the Democrats and their lapdogs , the Fake News Mainstream Media , are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence ... ..
Brian Ross , the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the Stock Market down 350 points ( billions of dollars ) , was suspended for a month but is now back at ABC NEWS in a lower capacity . He is no longer allowed to report on Trump . Should have been fired !
The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8 % , the lowest rate in 45 years . I am so happy about this News ! And , in the Washington Post ( of all places ) , headline states , ‚Äú Trumps first year jobs numbers were very , very good . ‚Äù

The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U.S. is booming ... but the people know ! Can you imagine if ‚Äú O ‚Äù was president and had these numbers - would be biggest story on earth ! Dow now over 25,000 .
I authorized Zero access to White House ( actually turned him down many times ) for author of phony book ! I never spoke to him for book . Full of lies , misrepresentations and sources that don ‚Äô t exist . Look at this guy ‚Äô s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve !

As Americans , you need identification , sometimes in a very strong and accurate form , for almost everything you do ... ..except when it comes to the most important thing , VOTING for the people that run your country . Push hard for Voter Identification !
Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud . They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally . System is rigged , must go to Voter I.D .

Stock Market had another good day but , now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed , we have tremendous upward potential . Dow just short of 25,000 , a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration . Also , unemployment went down to 4.1 % . Only getting better !

Will be leaving Florida for Washington ( D.C. ) today at 4:00 P.M. Much work to be done , but it will be a great New Year !
Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration . The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years . They are hungry for food & amp ; for freedom . Along with human rights , the wealth of Iran is being looted . TIME FOR CHANGE !
The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years , and they have given us nothing but lies & amp ; deceit , thinking of our leaders as fools . They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan , with little help . No more !
HAPPY NEW YEAR ! We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN , and much faster than anyone thought possible !
As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter , I want to wish all of my friends , supporters , enemies , haters , and even the very dishonest Fake News Media , a Happy and Healthy New Year . 2018 will be a great year for America !

. @ FoxNews-FBI ‚Äô s Andrew McCabe , ‚Äú in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M ( Clinton Puppet ) , he was using , allegedly , his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign . You obviously can not do this . These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton . ‚Äù
Remember , the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year . In Senate , I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost . Virginia candidate was not a ‚Äú Trumper , ‚Äù and he lost . Good Republican candidates will win BIG !
The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low . So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration , perhaps more than any other President in first year . Sadly , will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media !
Wow , ‚Äú FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned , ‚Äù according to @ FoxNews .
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits . 90 days to go ? ! ! !
How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , the man in charge , along with leakin ‚Äô James Comey , of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation ( including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails ) be given $ 700,000 for wife ‚Äô s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation ?

95 % of Americans will pay less or , at worst , the same amount of taxes ( mostly far less ) . The Dems only want to raise your taxes !
Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office . Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill .
With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals ( broke Harry Truman ‚Äô s Record ) , Regulation Cutting , Judicial Appointments , Building Military , VA , TAX CUTS & amp ; REFORM , Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more , I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news ?
‚Äú The President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year. ‚Äù Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA . Sadly , the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews . We are compiling a long & amp ; beautiful list .
At some point , and for the good of the country , I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion . Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start . After having foolishly spent $ 7 trillion in the Middle East , it is time to start rebuilding our country !

A story in the @ washingtonpost that I was close to ‚Äú rescinding ‚Äù the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS . I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court . The unnamed sources don ‚Äô t exist !

Alaska , Arizona , Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal . 7 years of Repeal & amp ; Replace and some Senators not there .
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag -- - we MUST honor and respect it ! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
RT @ DonnaWR8 : @ realDonaldTrump I wonder what this BRAVE American would give to stand on his OWN two legs just ONCE MORE for our # Anthem ? ‚Ä¶

WE CAN BOYCOTT YOU !

Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony . Great team !
Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country . Standing with locked arms is good , kneeling is not acceptable . Bad ratings !
... NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN . Boring games yes , but many stay away because they love our country . League should back U.S .
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & amp ; Country , you will see change take place fast . Fire or suspend !
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N . If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man , they wo n't be around much longer !
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand !
Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a `` moment of courage . '' Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived . 116 % increase !
Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have !
Very proud of our incredible First Lady ( @ FLOTUS . ) She is a truly great representative for our country ! https : //t.co/yFv0WIjgby
... our Great American Flag ( or Country ) and should stand for the National Anthem . If not , YOU 'RE FIRED . Find something else to do !
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL , or other leagues , he or she should not be allowed to disrespect ... .
Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating , therefore invitation is withdrawn !
It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama . What great people , what a crowd ! Vote Luther on Tuesday .
Alaska had a 200 % plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare , worst in the country . Deductibles high , people angry ! Lisa M comes through .
I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party !
Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do . Better control & amp ; management . Great for Arizona . McCain let his best friend L.G . down !
Arizona had a 116 % increase in ObamaCare premiums last year , with deductibles very high . Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods . Sad
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill , which his Governor loves . He campaigned on Repeal & amp ; Replace . Let Arizona down !
Heading to Alabama now , big crowd !
Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights . Fantastic job !

Will be in Alabama tonight . Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement , but will be very close . He loves Alabama , and so do I !

So why are n't the Committees and investigators , and of course our beleaguered A.G. , looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & amp ; Russia relations ?
After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found , Chuck Schumer just stated that `` Democrats should blame ourselves , not Russia . ''

If Republicans do n't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare , the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand !
It 's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion , even if should be positive , is bad !
It 's very sad that Republicans , even some that were carried over the line on my back , do very little to protect their President .

The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes . Even parts of full Repeal need 60 . 8 Dems control Senate . Crazy !
With only a very small majority , the Republicans in the House & amp ; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct , no votes !
As I have always said , let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan . Stay tuned !
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans . Most Republicans were loyal , terrific & amp ; worked really hard . We will return !
Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & amp ; work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate . Dems will join in !

Republican Senators are working very hard to get there , with no help from the Democrats . Not easy ! Perhaps just let OCare crash & amp ; burn !
..under a magnifying glass , they have zero `` tapes '' of T people colluding . There is no collusion & amp ; no obstruction . I should be given apology !
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling . With 4 months looking at Russia ...
... and did not want to `` rock the boat . '' He did n't `` choke , '' he colluded or obstructed , and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good .
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS , they have no policies or ideas . All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare !
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders . Is she allowed to so collude ? Unfair to Bernie !
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
I can not imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer !
Obama Administration official said they `` choked '' when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election . They did n't want to hurt Hillary ?
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling , why no action ? Focus on them , not T !
Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums & amp ; deductibles increase by over 100 % . Remember keep your doctor , keep your plan ?

Today , I announced an Air Traffic Control Initiative to take American air travel into the future - finally !

Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his `` no reason to be alarmed '' statement . MSM is working hard to sell it !
. @ foxandfriends Dems are taking forever to approve my people , including Ambassadors . They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS ! Want approvals .
In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe . The courts are slow and political !
The Justice Dept . should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & amp ; seek much tougher version !
The Justice Dept . should have stayed with the original Travel Ban , not the watered down , politically correct version they submitted to S.C .
People , the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want , but I am calling it what we need and what it is , a TRAVEL BAN !
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now ? That 's because they used knives and a truck !
At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is `` no reason to be alarmed ! ''
We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people . If we do n't get smart it will only get worse
Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K. , we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU . GOD BLESS !
We need to be smart , vigilant and tough . We need the courts to give us back our rights . We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety !

FAKE NEWS media knowingly does n't tell the truth . A great danger to our country . The failing @ nytimes has become a joke . Likewise @ CNN . Sad !

The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election , and so badly ( 306 ) , so they made up a story - RUSSIA . Fake news !
FAKE NEWS media , which makes up stories and `` sources , '' is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast !
The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers ! They will be caught !
Leaking , and even illegal classified leaking , has been a big problem in Washington for years . Failing @ nytimes ( and others ) must apologize !

Information is being illegally given to the failing @ nytimes & amp ; @ washingtonpost by the intelligence community ( NSA and FBI ? ) .Just like Russia
This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton 's losing campaign .

An extended interview from the Super Bowl with @ oreillyfactor airs tonight at 8:00 P.M . Enjoy ! https : //t.co/kZdHqaNTVR
The failing @ nytimes writes total fiction concerning me . They have gotten it wrong for two years , and now are making up stories & amp ; sources !
I call my own shots , largely based on an accumulation of data , and everyone knows it . Some FAKE NEWS media , in order to marginalize , lies !
Any negative polls are fake news , just like the CNN , ABC , NBC polls in the election . Sorry , people want border security and extreme vetting .
What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots . Tom Brady , Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners . Wow !
Enjoy the # SuperBowl and then we continue : MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY . The courts are making the job very difficult !
Just can not believe a judge would put our country in such peril . If something happens blame him and court system . People pouring in . Bad !
The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart . Bad people are very happy !
Interview with @ oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4:00 P.M. ( prior to Super Bowl ) . Enjoy !
Why are n't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston , which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision ?
Because the ban was lifted by a judge , many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country . A terrible decision
What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone , even with bad intentions , can come into U.S. ?
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election , the FAKE NEWS @ nytimes is still lost !
The opinion of this so-called judge , which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country , is ridiculous and will be overturned !
Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban . They know if certain people are allowed in it 's death & amp ; destruction !
When a country is no longer able to say who can , and who can not , come in & amp ; out , especially for reasons of safety & amp ; .security - big trouble !
Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us !
We must keep `` evil '' out of our country !

@ AaronKleinShow What Winer omits ‚Äî and Aaron Klein discovered ‚Äî is that his `` legal and consulting practice , '' where he was a senior vice president , did extensive pro bono work for the Clinton Global Initiative ... for almost a decade .
@ AaronKleinShow Winer admits that he worked for Bill Clinton 's administration through the '90s -- then returned to the State Dept . in 2013 under Kerry/Obama .

In between ? `` After 1999 , I left the State Department and developed a legal and consulting practice that often involved Russian matters . ''
@ AaronKleinShow `` Given that I had not worked with Shearer and knew that he was not a professional intelligence officer , I did not mention or share his notes with anyone at the State Department , '' Winer wrote .

`` But I learned later that Steele did share them ‚Äî with the FBI . ''
@ AaronKleinShow Winer said that he passed on information from Cody Shearer , another Clinton hatchet man , to Steele ‚Äî some similar oppo research claiming Russia had compromising info on Trump . Winer described Shearer as a `` journalist , '' omitting his connections to Clinton World .
@ AaronKleinShow Winer said he had been friends with Christopher Steele ‚Äî the former British spy who authored the infamous `` pee '' dossier with $ $ from Fusion GPS , the DNC , and the Clinton Campaign via Perkins Coie ‚Äî since 2009 .
Very important investigation from @ AaronKleinShow :

We 're committed to ensuring that 70,000 more children and young people each year will have access to high-quality NHS mental healthcare by 2020-21 and are making available an additional ¬£1.4 billion to improve children and young people ‚Äô s mental health services . # PMQs
We ‚Äô re committed to seeing mental health services improve on the ground . This is backed with a significant increase in funding ‚Äì spending on mental health has increased to a record ¬£11.6 billion , with a further ¬£1 billion by 2020/21 . # PMQs

PM : So join me on this journey . Come with me as I lead Britain . Strengthen my hand as I fight for Britain . https : //t.co/EyLQ5pkTJl
That is the goal . This is the plan . And now is the time .
A stronger , fairer , more prosperous Britain that works for everyone , not just a privileged few .
And confident in the belief that we have the vision , the plan and the will to use this moment to build a better Britain .
With a resolute determination to get on with the job of delivering Brexit . Optimism that I can get a deal that works for all .
So I offer myself as your Prime Minister .
And after all that has passed , that is a vision of the future that can bring us together .
Every vote for me and my team will be a vote for a stronger , fairer , more prosperous Britain .
Because every vote for me and my team in this election will strengthen my hand in the negotiations to come .
Now more than ever , Britain needs a clear plan and the determination and the will to see it through .
We need that strong and stable leadership now more than ever .
Tackling the long-term challenges we face , and ensuring everyone in our country has the chance to get on in life .
But most importantly , the Government I lead will provide strong and stable leadership to see us through Brexit and beyond .
Record & amp ; fair school funding . Real technical education for young people . And the first ever proper plan to pay for & amp ; provide social care .
It ‚Äô s why the Government I lead will build a Britain in which the economy is strong to support world-class public services .
Why we will help those struggling to afford a home of their own by building more affordable homes .
Why the Government I lead will keep taxes low & amp ; cap rip-off energy tariffs to help families working all the hours they can to pay the bills .
Why the Government I lead will build a Britain in which work pays , with a higher National Living Wage & amp ; proper rights & amp ; protections at work .
That is why the Government I lead will ensure every area of this United Kingdom is able to prosper .
A force that steps up and acts in the interests of ordinary working people .
For while it is never true that government has all the answers , government can and should be a force for good .
And they look to their government for help and support . This party ‚Äì the Conservative and Unionist Party ‚Äì will be that government .
They just want to get on with their lives , to do their best for their children , and to be given a fair chance .
For too many people in Britain today , life is simply much harder than many seem to think or realise .
If we get Brexit right , we can use this moment of change to build a stronger , fairer , more prosperous Britain here at home . https : //t.co/nk9883flRm
We 'll make the decisions that matter to Britain here in Britain https : //t.co/r6UQA6PvrC
So we will leave the European Union and take control of our money , take control of our borders and take control of our laws .
The British people made their choice . I respect that . I respect the view of other European leaders who agree we can ‚Äô t be half-in , half-out .
That is why I have been clear that we do not seek to fudge this issue - to be half-in and half-out of the EU .

The influence of Iran in the region is dangerous .

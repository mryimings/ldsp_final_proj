@AaronKleinShow What Winer omits ‚Äî and Aaron Klein discovered ‚Äî is that his "legal and consulting practice," where he was a senior vice president, did extensive pro bono work for the Clinton Global Initiative... for almost a decade.
@AaronKleinShow Winer admits that he worked for Bill Clinton's administration through the '90s -- then returned to the State Dept. in 2013 under Kerry/Obama. 

In between? "After 1999, I left the State Department and developed a legal and consulting practice that often involved Russian matters."
@AaronKleinShow "Given that I had not worked with Shearer and knew that he was not a professional intelligence officer, I did not mention or share his notes with anyone at the State Department," Winer wrote.

"But I learned later that Steele did share them ‚Äî with the FBI."
@AaronKleinShow Winer said that he passed on information from Cody Shearer, another Clinton hatchet man, to Steele ‚Äî some similar oppo research claiming Russia had compromising info on Trump. Winer described Shearer as a "journalist," omitting his connections to Clinton World.
@AaronKleinShow Winer said he had been friends with Christopher Steele ‚Äî the former British spy who authored the infamous "pee" dossier with $$ from Fusion GPS, the DNC, and the Clinton Campaign via Perkins Coie ‚Äî since 2009.
Very important investigation from @AaronKleinShow:

A couple weeks ago, WaPo ran an op-ed from a man named Jonathan Winer titled: "Devin Nunes is investigating me. Here‚Äôs the truth." https://t.co/IblaikbdBz

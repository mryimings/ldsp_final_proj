We can't let the second act be pillaging from the programs (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) that actually help low and middle income Americans the most in the false name of fiscal responsibility.
The devastating first act of the #GOPTaxScam and phony fiscal conservatism has been to explode our nation’s deficit to provide enormous benefit to the rich and powerful.
The GOP treated our tax dollars like monopoly money. This debt is a burden we will be passing onto our children and it'll take generations to pay it off. #TaxDay.
The CBO has predicted the #GOPTaxScam would cost us roughly $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. So much for the GOP’s promise that these tax cuts would pay for themselves. #TaxDay.
It doesn’t stop there. More than 100,000 employees at large corporations have lost their jobs. Remind me how this bill was supposed to bring about tax relief for working families? #TaxDay
They took their tax-payer funded tax cut, turned right around &amp; gave their wealthy CEOs &amp; shareholders a raise. In 2018, large corporations have announced over $235 billion in share buybacks – far outpacing the rate of companies announcing one-time bonuses for workers. #TaxDay

Let’s come together and work on bipartisan ideas to improve upon the law and make the next 8 years even better than the last.
Despite GOP attempts to rip health care away from 20 million Americans (and their ongoing sabotage efforts which are driving up premiums), this law turns 8 today.
Health plans must cover basic, important health care needs – from doctor and hospital visits, to prescription drugs, to mental health and substance abuse treatment.
Insurance companies can no longer deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition … and they can’t impose lifetime/annual caps on your benefits.
The Affordable Care Act turns 8 years old today.
 
Because of this law, more than 20 million people have gained health insurance (including one million Illinoisans).

We can't continue to let the NRA have veto power over gun policy in this nation. We are facing an epidemic of violence, with hundreds of Americans shot every day. Let’s put the safety of our kids and our neighborhoods ahead of the gun lobby’s agenda of selling more guns.

Opioid quota reform is needed so DEA can take important factors like diversion and abuse into account when setting quotas, rather than only chasing the downstream consequences of this crisis.
DEA plays an important gatekeeper role over the volume of opioids that can be produced each year. And while DEA has taken recent steps to lower opioid quotas, their ability to do so is limited.
14 billion opioid doses are put on the market each year—far more than necessary under current medical guidelines and enough for every adult American to have their own bottle of addictive painkillers.
Such increases occurred largely because current law directs DEA to only consider certain factors when setting quotas—like past sales and estimated demand—but not other factors such as the impact of such opioid production on diversion, abuse rates, or overdose deaths.
DEA approved significant increases in aggregate opioid production quotas between 1993 and 2015, including a 39-fold increase for oxycodone and a 12-fold increase for hydrocodone.
Every day, more than 100 Americans die from an opioid overdose. While we know that there are legitimate uses for opioid painkillers, we also know that these dangerous pills are being over-produced, over-prescribed, and over-dispensed.
I’ve joined @SenJohnKennedy, @SenFeinstein and @ChuckGrassley to introduce a bill that would strengthen DEA’s ability to prevent opioid abuse. The agency should be able to consider the opioid epidemic’s downstream effects when setting quota levels for opioid production each year.

Today is the 53rd anniversary of Bloody Sunday, a day to remember and honor the courageous men &amp; women who marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to draw attention to the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans in the Deep South.
It is incredible to see students and businesses across the country taking a leadership role in addressing gun violence. They have decided it’s time to act, and they are acting. Republicans need to finally step up and help us get gun safety done.
I also stand with the significant majorities of Americans who want to take military-style assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks off of our streets. These are weapons of war, and they have no place in our neighborhoods.
I stand with the 97% of Americans who support universal background checks for gun sales. We have to close the loopholes in our laws that make it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on guns.

The American people can now see the President’s agenda for what it is, and it’s not protecting Dreamers.
Democrats and a handful of courageous Republicans tried to free the Dreamers by paying that $25 billion ransom for Trump’s infamous border wall. But he rejected that offer.
Yesterday the Senate rejected the President’s immigration plan by a bipartisan supermajority.
Dramatically cutting the number of immigrants from African countries that he hatefully disparaged.
Fast-tracking deportations of Central American women and children fleeing gang and sexual violence.
Reducing legal immigration by more than 40 percent by barring Americans from sponsoring their parents, siblings and children as immigrants.
Let’s be honest, President Trump’s plan is to ransom these young Dreamers in exchange for his entire anti-immigrant agenda.

Joining @Morning_Joe soon to discuss the latest on the Dream Act in the Senate. Hope you can tune in.
The President’s immigration framework would fast-track deportations of children who come to our border fleeing war, gangs, and sexual violence. It would be unconscionable to do this to families in the midst of the world’s worst refugee crisis.
On the backs of Dreamers, the White House is attempting to radically slash legal immigration by prohibiting American citizens from reuniting with their parents, siblings, and children. This isn’t what America should stand for.
President Trump has rejected three separate offers to fund his broadly unpopular wall in exchange for the broadly popular Dream Act.
We have to end this needless delay now. I joined a bipartisan group of Senators today, urging congressional leadership to do the right thing by American families and pass a funding extension for community health centers ASAP.
Community health centers provide affordable health care to 27 million Americans, including 1.3 million Illinoisans. They're invaluable everywhere, but especially in rural communities. And yet, more than four months ago, Congress allowed funding for these health clinics to expire.

So let me get this straight: @BetsyDeVosED protects poor performing for-profit schools from being held accountable under the Gainful Employment Rule, but she's going to punish defrauded student borrowers? This is an outrage. https://t.co/rnVybfiRgm

Just in: Senate GOP rams through partisan tax bill that will hurt millions of working families across the country while the wealthiest 1% &amp; largest corporations receive nothing short of a windfall #GOPTaxScam
The bottom line is that Republicans believe we can afford to add $1.5T to the national debt when it comes to giving tax cuts to the wealthy, but we can’t afford it when it comes to helping the most vulnerable in our society. #GOPTaxScam
The real surprise here is that many of the so-called “fiscal hawks” in the Republican Party are ready to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit after complaining about our national debt for the last 8 years under President Obama. #GOPTaxScam
I’m on the Senate floor touting the #GOPTaxScam for what it is – a massive give-away to corporate special-interests, campaign donors, and the wealthiest Americans. Watch live here: https://t.co/x87BhFnet2
The nonpartisan @USCBO says that 13 million Americans will lose their health insurance &amp; insurance premium costs will go up by 10% each year if the #GOPTaxScam is signed into law.
After failing miserably to achieve one of their campaign promises to repeal the #ACA &amp; take away #healthcare from millions of families, Republicans have slipped in to the #GOPTaxScam a provision that will undermine our health care system.
Why are the GOP rushing through their partisan #GOPTaxScam? Because if the bill were to receive proper scrutiny, it would be revealed for what it is—a monumental give-away to corporate special-interests, campaign donors, and the wealthiest Americans.
For Maria Rocha, for hundreds of thousands of other young people, they’re counting on Congress to do something. Let’s not come up with excuses. Let’s come up with answers. Let’s pass the #DreamActNow.
Maria was accepted into @TeachForAmerica after graduating from @UTSA &amp; currently teaches third grade in her home town. But without #DACA, Maria would not be able to work and could be deported immediately.
Today I shared the story of Maria Rocha, a #Dreamer from San Antonio, on the Senate floor. It was the 103rd #Dreamer story I’ve told to date. https://t.co/kP5kiJT21Y
Let’s be clear: the Senate will not be voting on the #TaxCutsandJobsAct tonight. We will be voting on the mashed-up #GOPTaxScam / #ArcticRefuge Drilling / #Healthcare Repeal bill.

I promised then that I would never give up the fight to pass the #DreamAct. I will continue to stand by the #Dreamers until Congress recognizes that this great land is their home.
It was a moment for Congress to show courage, but it didn't. I hope history won’t repeat itself. We must pass the #DreamActNow &amp; give these courageous, inspiring young people a path to citizenship.
Seven years ago today, a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted for the #DreamAct but it didn’t become the law of the land because of a partisan filibuster. https://t.co/3W0Urekj5i
We cannot allow the horrific state of life in Puerto Rico to become the status quo. Congress must approve critical disaster relief funding now.

I promise to continue to fight on behalf of gun violence victims, including the children &amp; women who were murdered at #SandyHook five years ago. They will not be forgotten. https://t.co/Yz5fWHUeuX
We have seen far too many lives lost – in #SandyHook, in Chicago, in towns and communities across America – to stand by silently.  We must act to reduce the deadly toll of gunfire.
While mass shootings continue to occur with horrifying frequency in the U.S., the gun lobby and the Republican Congress are trying to weaken laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.  That is wrong.
And sadly, Congress has done nothing – nothing – to try to prevent another senseless tragedy like #SandyHook from happening again. Instead, last week, the GOP-controlled House of Reps. passed legislation that would weaken gun laws on the books in many states, including Illinois.
5 years ago today, 12 little girls, 8 little boys, and 6 educators were senselessly &amp; heinously murdered at #SandyHook a mere 11 days before they were supposed to celebrate the Christmas holiday w their family &amp; friends. It remains one of the darkest days of my time in Congress.

That is far too high. I'll continue to work with DEA to bring these opioid quotas down to a lower level of legitimate medical need. 
 
With over 200 million opioid prescriptions written and tens of thousands of people dying, Congress &amp; the DEA have a responsibility to act.
However, drug companies still flood the market with an estimated 14 billion opioid pills – enough for every adult in America to have a one-month prescription.
Since 2016, DEA has met with me several times &amp; worked to lower opioid quotas 2 years in a row. Aggregate production quotas are now down by an average of 41 percent from where they were in 2016 https://t.co/m3zv9fbY5e
Between 1993 &amp; 2015, DEA allowed production of oxycodone to increase 39-fold and hydrocodone to increase 12-fold.  With higher quotas, opioid prescriptions soared – from 76 million in 1991 to 245 million in 2014 – and overdose deaths quadrupled to more than 33,000 in 2015.
At today's Judiciary Committee hearing, I questioned the DEA Acting Assistant Administrator on the DEA's role in the rise of the national opioid addiction epidemic. Watch below https://t.co/speMaCe2vJ

Republican health care promises do not match reality. I urge my colleagues to actually do something for the Americans we serve and and work with us to strengthen our health care system.
Republicans promised to lower health insurance premiums.
 
Instead they’ve acted to increase premiums via repeal, sabotage, and refusing to pass bipartisan health care stabilization bills.
Republicans promised to treat the opioid epidemic like an emergency.
 
Yet there has been no emergency funding to respond to it.
Republicans promised to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. 
 
Instead, their #GOPTaxScam lowered the corporate tax rate for Big Pharma.
Health care funding for 9 million kids expired more than 2 months ago.

@USCBO @jctgov This is what the greatest deliberative body has come to. A sad day for the United States Senate and the people we are supposed to be serving.
@USCBO @jctgov Republicans have rejected input from Democrats, from experts — and from most importantly the American people.
The non-partisan @USCBO and @jctgov have not analyzed the bill’s impacts on our economy and American taxpayers.
There have been 0 hearings on this tax bill that’s being clumsily put together behind closed doors.
Let’s talk about how today Senate Republicans will force a vote on a bill that neither of them has read. #GOPTaxScam
America already has a big doctor shortage and we could lose 5,400 more physicians unless Congress passes the #DREAMActNow. https://t.co/vRgzhc1cSo

Under the Republican tax plan, America’s seniors will see their health insurance premiums increase by an average of $1,490 according to the @AARP.  

Our seniors deserve better that this.
Reminder: Republicans are still making last minute changes to their tax bill — and they want to vote on it tonight. The American people don’t even know what’s in their final #GOPTaxScam.
Just when you thought the #GOPTaxScam couldn’t get any worse, Senate Republicans just voted to let corporations ship jobs overseas. My amendment with @SenSherrodBrown would have stopped that. https://t.co/5ro2rDrrrO

Republicans could be working to pass a tax reform bill that benefits working families instead of this partisan boondoggle for the wealthy. But they’re not.
Republicans could be working to pass comprehensive background checks for every gun sale which 95% of Americans support (94% of gun owners).
Republicans could be working to reauthorize funding for community health centers which serve 27 million Americans.
Republicans could be working to strengthen our health care system instead of throwing 13 million off their health insurance and raising premiums by 10%.
Republicans could bring the bipartisan #DreamAct to the floor so 800,000 young people aren’t deported from the country they love.
Instead of ramming through their tax scam, Republicans could be working to reauthorize health care for 9 million children. It’s been 2 months.
Senate Republicans just voted to advance a bill that will lead to 13 million Americans losing their health care, insurance premiums increasing by hundreds of dollars, and taxes going up for working families.
The Republican tax plan is for their deep-pocketed donors, not ordinary Americans. Retweet if you think so too.

From @politico: Republican Senator “Kennedy said he opposed Katsas’ confirmation to the appellate court in D.C. because of a ‘conflict of interest’ that the senator argued ‘a first-year law student would see.’”
What issues did Katsas work on? The Muslim ban, emoluments, the Administration's cruel decision to end #DACA, and much more.
Senate Republicans confirmed a Trump White House lawyer to serve on America's second highest court. Gregory Katsas can now rule on policies he played a role in creating. Plain wrong. #CourtsMatter

Fourth, the Rohingya prison camps in Myanmar must be closed and all Rohingya must be free to travel, work, send their kids to school, access to health care, and gain citizenship.
Third, if any Rohingya choose to return to Myanmar, the process of repatriation must be monitored by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
Second, we must require that those in the Myanmar military responsible for crimes against humanity be held personally accountable in an international tribunal.
First, we must demand full access by the official UN fact-finding mission, NGOs, and the press to North Rakhine to verify the devastation &amp; discourage even more exploitation.
The Myanmar military has burned hundreds of villages to the ground and there are countless reports of rape, starvation, and mass killings. America cannot ignore it.

27,000 Americans have parents who are TPS recipients from Haiti. The Trump Admin is forcing parents to choose between leaving their kids behind or living in fear of deportation. Cruel.
It’s dangerous and irresponsible to force local police departments to choose between redirecting scarce policing resources to carry out the Trump/Sessions mass deportation agenda or else sacrificing critical violence prevention funds.

@POTUS These are people’s lives we’re talking about.
@POTUS As a result of his most recent action, individual market premiums will increase 20% next year. 25% by 2020.
@POTUS Perhaps @POTUS thinks it's comical or fun to hurt American families out of spite. The actions he's taken this week make it seem that way.
After failing to convince GOP to pass heartless #TrumpCare, @POTUS now single-handedly destroying our health care system by Executive Order.
Born into wealth, President Trump has likely never spent a day of his life worried about being able to afford health care for his family.
The nonpartisan CBO estimates this will raise premiums by 20%. The President is destroying health care to make a political point. https://t.co/XWJSroY1ye

And we must address serious questions about the legality, morality &amp; efficacy of President Trump’s anti-immigrant &amp; anti-refugee policies
As border apprehensions decline drastically, we must shift our lmtd resources&amp;take a comprehensive approach to fixing our immigration system
RT @RI4A: Chairman @JohnCornyn, you can #BuildAmericasTrust by standing up to @POTUS’s anti-immigrant &amp; anti-refugee agenda
.@HurdOnTheHill, whose district covers 800mi of border, described the wall as, “the most expensive&amp;least effective way to secure the border”
It's estimated the wall will cost nearly $70bn to build &amp; $150m/year to maintain – and American taxpayers, not Mexico, would be on the hook
President Trump’s assessment that we must build a “big, beautiful wall” on the Southern border doesn’t square with reality
According to @CBP statistics, the # of apprehensions the southern border dropped from about 1.6 million in FY2000 to about 408,000 in FY2016
From FY2003 to FY 2016, the number of immigration agents nearly tripled and the number of Border Patrol agents nearly doubled
RT @AmericasVoice: .@SenatorDurbin: US spends more on immigration enforcement than ALL other fed enforcement COMBINED. Yet @JohnCornyn says…
Border security is important, but we already spend more on immigration enforcement than all other federal law enforcement agencies combined

.@IHAhospitals predicts that #TrumpCare would result in more than 55,000 job losses in Illinois alone
Next year alone, #TrumpCare would take health insurance away from 311k Illinoisans with private health plans &amp; 170k who depend on Medicaid
What would it mean for Illinois if Trump &amp; the Republicans have their way with repealing health care?
Happy #ArborDay. Did you know a large tree can provide a day’s supply of oxygen for up to four people?
.@DEAHQ Drug manufacturers need to stop flooding the market with addictive painkillers and deceiving patients &amp; docs about risks
.@DEAHQ US health care providers wrote 245 million prescriptions for painkillers in 2014, enough for every adult American to have a month’s supply
.@DEAHQ Deaths from prescription opioids quadrupled since 1999 and 4 of 5 new heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioids
.@DEAHQ The road to opioid addiction can begin in your bathroom medicine cabinet. Parents, don’t hold on to unused pills.
On last year’s Take Back day, @DEAHQ collected nearly 450 tons of medicine at more than 5,000 sites in all 50 states.
National Prescription Drug #TakeBack Day is Saturday. Clean out the medicine cabinet &amp; find a local collection site https://t.co/Od0TB0Aqq0
I hope that many people will tell Trump that this is no way to celebrate 100 days, by taking health insurance away from 24 million people
The #ACA did away with that, but those dark days would be back if Trump &amp; the Republicans have their way https://t.co/02HniuXMP8
It would allow insurance companies to charge sky-high premiums if you or family member has history of asthma, cancer, or diabetes
#Trumpcare would raise costs on Americans aged 50 &amp; above and would gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions
The latest GOP health care repeal attempt makes a bad #Trumpcare bill even worse
Today, we mark #WorkersMemorialDay in honor of those who have lost their lives on the job. Every worker deserves a safe workplace.

We should be strengthening America's international affairs budget. Slashing it is counterproductive and makes the world more dangerous.
.@AARP This is not a drill. Call your senators and representatives. #Trumpcare would be a nightmare for America and it must be stopped.
.@AARP .@ AmerMedicalAssn: we are deeply concerned that AHCA would result in millions of Americans losing their current health insurance coverage
.@AARP .@ American_Heart: the 10 essential health benefits included in the #ACA set a min standard for quality heart care. The AHCA falls far short
.@AARP @AARP: we are concerned that the AHCA will dramatically increase premium and out-of-pocket costs for 50-64 year olds purchasing coverage
.@AARP: insurance companies could once again charge people w preexisting conditions more because they’ve had cancer, diabetes, heart disease
Why? It would take health care away from 24 million Americans. Their new version is even worse: it will bring back pre-existing conditions.
The latest GOP plan to repeal health care is opposed by doctors, nurses, seniors, and every major group that cares about patients.

The banks’ own study shows small businesses are satisfied with debit fees under the swipe reform law. Repeal would raise those fees.
Big banks are already making record profits. No need to let them rig the debit swipe fee system again
Repealing swipe fee reform would be a gut punch to Main Street restaurants, retailers, &amp; gas stations. It would raise prices &amp; cost jobs
Now the big banks &amp; their friends in Congress want to repeal this reform, doubling the average debit swipe fee
Even though banks fought this reform every step of the way, it has boosted competition &amp; reduced debit fees
In 2010, Congress passed swipe fee reform to rein in Visa &amp; MasterCard’s debit fee-fixing on behalf of big banks
That’s a rigged system. It avoids competition and makes merchants/ consumers pay banks billions in excessive fees
For years I’ve heard big banks argue to let Visa &amp; MasterCard fix swipe fee rates on their behalf

This move threatens our culture, history, &amp; heritage. And if Trump decides to get rid of 1 of these Monuments, he’ll be in uncharted waters
As I was announcing this bill in the Senate, Trump was launching a “review” of National Monuments, putting these resources in grave jeopardy

I will vote no when Gorsuch comes before the Judiciary Cmte. I will vote no on cloture. I will oppose his nomination on the Senate floor.
With the legal and constitutional issues haunting this White House, the Senate cannot rubber stamp a lifetime appointment for this President
60 votes is a threshold that #SCOTUS nominees have met for the past ¼ century. If Gorsuch falls short, then Trump should pick a new nominee.
Majority Leader McConnell has made clear time and time again that 60 votes is the standard for matters of controversy in the Senate.
No one should be surprised that Judge Gorsuch will need to meet the threshold of 60 Senate votes in order to be confirmed.
I came away from his hearing firmly convinced that I must oppose the nomination of Judge Gorsuch.
Judge Gorsuch was given a full and fair hearing. He was given every opportunity to explain his judicial record and his views.
He needed to show that he'd be an independent check on President Trump and rule against the right-wing groups that picked him if required
Judge Gorsuch needed to be straight with the American people about his record and his views—avoiding critical questions was unacceptable
Judge Gorsuch needed to demonstrate that he would uphold and defend the Constitution for ALL of us, not just the privileged few

This is a constitutional moment. America’s integrity is at stake—we need an AG willing to defend our Constitution&amp; stand up for what’s right
Based on his record &amp; his responses to questions raised by this Cmte &amp; by me, I am not confident that Senator Sessions would be such an AG
.@TheJusticeDept motto — Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur — refers to an AG “who prosecutes on behalf of justice”
Where wld Sen Sessions stand on these issues if he's AG? Wld he stand up the Pres if his actions are unlawful? I think we know the answer
But it's also the duty of America’s chief law enforcement officer to stand up to the Pres when his actions do not serve interests of justice
On issue after issue, Senator Sessions has said that, as Attorney General, he would simply ‘enforce the law’
As America’s chief law enforcement officer, the AG has vast authority &amp; discretion over how the law is enforced &amp; who it is enforced against

I know that if we brought the Thompson-King bill to expand background checks up for a vote, it would pass. It’s a solid plan supported by Members of both parties. @SpeakerRyan should let the House vote.
We owe the families affected by gun violence a truly effective plan to save lives &amp; stop the daily tragedy of gun violence. #NeverAgain #EndGunViolence
While I am glad to see that @realDonaldTrump wants to ban bump stocks, I think it is clear this must be done through Congressional action. I hope we can proceed in a bipartisan way. #NeverAgain

Let me be clear: there is no such thing as a “good shutdown.” #TrumpShutdown
During the 2013 #GOPShutdown, @realDonaldTrump said of Pres. Obama “the problems start from the top and have to get solved from the top…”

But as President, he says “our country needs a good shutdown.” #TrumpShutdown
.@realDonaldTrump, @HouseGOP, &amp; @SenateGOP were so obsessed with the #GOPTaxScam, they were blinded to their duties to the American people. Despite controlling the White House, House, &amp; Senate, their incompetence meant they couldn’t keep government open. #TrumpShutdown

.@RepThompson knows that fighting for America’s middle class families, seniors, &amp; veterans means we have to fight the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/hggJWKnRzW
The path before us is clear: Congress must act quickly to #SaveTheInternet by passing @USRepMikeDoyle’s resolution to overturn this disastrous decision. https://t.co/caWgKrXhKL
.@AjitPaiFCC has eagerly led the effort to saddle consumers with higher costs and less choice, throttle competition and punish entrepreneurs and small businesses. #NetNeutrality
The power of the Internet has always been rooted in its role as a level playing field where the best ideas, not the deepest pockets, succeed. The @FCC’s decision to repeal #NetNeutrality is nothing short of radical.
Five years after #SandyHook, it’s still difficult to come to terms with the tragedy of that day. But this much is clear – even now, the only option we have is to #HonorWithAction. Anything less – anything – is unacceptable. https://t.co/pRSoOK053f
The @FCC just voted to throw away #NetNeutrality, which is central to saving families money, creating good-paying jobs, and empowering small businesses. https://t.co/ReB2ROxWF0
#NetNeutrality is what gives you the power to use to apps, games, and websites you like, no matter what your internet company thinks. The threat of losing that – and seeing costs go up for families – is why we must #SaveTheInternet from the @FCC. https://t.co/p0v6Eg5NKm
Forget CRomnibus — @HouseGOP’s proposed funding package is a “puntibus” that leaves urgent, must-address issues for another day. #DoYourJob
#NetNeutrality is central to building a good economy and ensuring we are creating high-quality, good-paying jobs for the 21st Century. @FCC should delay its vote to destroy it.
The idea that the @FCC’s process for throwing out #NetNeutrality could be in any way fraudulent is deeply concerning. We must protect the open internet!
At this point, it’s clear tax cuts for the rich are part of the Republicans’ DNA, no matter who it hurts. #GOPTaxScam #BillionairesFirst
With every version, the #GOPTaxScam becomes an even more brazen, damaging, and immoral con job. And all signs are the American people aren’t falling for it.
Republicans should think twice before voting for the #GOPTaxScam. Trickle down didn’t work before. It won’t work now. And Americans won’t forget who raised their taxes and left them holding the bill. https://t.co/AD3anREdnh

How many will suffer under this #RxForDisaster? Republicans are clearly afraid of the answer. https://t.co/3XiuavfqS6
So I have to ask: who really is failing the transparency test here? (hint: it's not the Democrats)
On the other hand, Republicans seem to have forgotten they hid the #RxForDisaster in the Capitol basement last week.
And the #ACA is stronger because of that input.
(That’s not even counting the thousands of calls, emails, and letters we received)
Outside Washington, @HouseDemocrats held 3,000 town halls and events to hear from our constituents on the bill.
And the bill was posted for *30 days* before the first committee held a vote on ACA.
239 amendments from both Dems and Republicans were considered. 121 ended up being accepted.
Members talked with over 181 witnesses (both D&amp;R) during nearly 100 hours of hearings.
There were 79 hearings and markups in 2009 &amp; 2010 on the ACA.

(Those were bipartisan meetings, for the record)
The truth? ACA resulted from one of the most transparent drafting processes in recent memory.
Word of advice to the White House: stick to reality. Health care is a big deal and we can’t afford any #alternativefacts.
Sec. Price seems confused. He *says* he wants  “patient care” – but the #RxForDisaster he’s pushing would kick 11 million off Medicaid.

Republicans don't believe in constraining the greed on Wall Street at all -- no matter how it impacts our communities. #WallStreetFirst
Proof that @POTUS is putting #WallStreetFirst? No jobs bill in sight -- and a dangerous #MuslimBan to distract us.
What happened on Wall Street was about greed -- and the price was paid by American communities and hard-working families. #WallStreetFirst
President Trump's #WallStreetFirst agenda is an assault on Main Street.

The Trump Administration’s #MuslimBan violates the pact between the American people and our government.
The #ACA had three goals
- Lower costs
- Expand coverage
- Improve benefits

On all three fronts, it has succeeded.

American farmers are already living under the uncertainty caused by low commodity prices and the potential impact of President Trump’s reckless trade policies.  They don’t need the added anxiety of House Republicans injecting partisan politics into the #FarmBill. 2/4

Read more here about why @CenterOnBudget is speaking out in opposition to @HouseGOP’s hypocritical Balanced Budget Amendment that would leave Americans’ Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block. https://t.co/SpYiPhO18i https://t.co/Up1Qocobou
It is the epitome of hypocrisy for @HouseGOP to bring their “Balanced Budget Amendment” to the Floor after adding $1.8 trillion to the deficit to give tax cuts to the wealthy. I spoke on the Floor in opposition to this political stunt: https://t.co/L9trL0hUGM
Republican Representative Thomas Massie is right. Republicans’ Balanced Budget Amendment is a political stunt after Republicans exploded the deficit by $1.8 trillion with the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/SpYiPhwpJI https://t.co/GbJkfxDS4s
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @TulsiPress. Thank you for your advocacy for and leadership on behalf of working families in #HI02.
I agree with Senator Bob Corker. Bringing a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Floor after slashing taxes for the wealthy is not a serious attempt to address the deficit and is the height of hypocrisy. https://t.co/SpYiPhO18i https://t.co/ALPhSs36QX
Joined @RepBarbaraLee to speak out against @POTUS’s executive order to undermine anti-poverty programs. Democrats want to get more Americans out of poverty &amp; into the workforce, but pulling the rug out from under working families is not the way to do it: https://t.co/L1wK5j97Xm

After passing a $1.8 trillion tax cut for the wealthy, Republicans are bringing a hypocritical Balanced Budget Amendment to the Floor that would significantly cut Medicare &amp; Social Security. Read why @AARP opposes the legislation here: https://t.co/SpYiPhO18i https://t.co/J1v06BCznZ
Today the @HouseGOP is considering a hypocritical “Balanced Budget Amendment” to give cover to Republicans for adding $1.8 trillion to the deficit to give tax cuts to the wealthy. It is a political stunt that would force cuts to Medicare &amp; Social Security. https://t.co/RwAMjdG2Io

Now that Paul Ryan is no longer encumbered by having to run for re-election to the speakership, I hope he will use this opportunity – as John Boehner did before him – to rise above internecine, factional squabbles in his party &amp; work with Democrats to address critical challenges.
.@SpeakerRyan has been a faithful public servant for WI &amp; our country. While we stood on opposite sides, I’ve found him a gracious &amp; good-natured man who believes in service &amp; treating others with respect. I wish him, Janna &amp; their children all the best. https://t.co/oyG0V9bsyz

On #EqualPayDay, we mark the time it takes a woman to earn the same amount as a man if both started Jan 1 of last year. The wage gap is not only unfair but harmful to working families.

I said to press that I disagree with @RealDonaldTrump’s decision to deploy troops to the border. While we believe in secure borders, this is a distraction from the real issues we need to address, including solving the DACA crisis he created.
I also told reporters that the @HouseGOP’s Balanced Budget Amendment is a political stunt that puts Medicare &amp; Social Security on the chopping block after they added $1.5 trillion to the deficit with the #GOPTaxScam.
Today, I told reporters I just returned from my 3rd #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour with stops in WI with @RepMarkPocan &amp; @RepRonKind. This is part of House Dems’ effort to show Americans that we are listening and we understand the economic insecurity they feel.

When speaking with reporters, I said I was appalled by @RealDonaldTrump’s attempt to seek favor with Putin by congratulating him on winning his sham election.
It is unacceptable that @SpeakerRyan is refusing to allow a vote to #ProtectDREAMers. GOP leaders ought to put DACA legislation on the Floor under the Queen of the Hill Rule &amp; let the House work its will.
I also told press that Republicans have had more than 6 months to get their job done and fund the government. We’ll see what they put forward, but they need to drop poison pill riders from the omnibus funding bill if they want Dem support.
I reiterated that the Congress must take action to #EndGunViolence. I agree with a MD student who said last week during the #NationalSchoolWalkout: “Their right to an assault rifle does not outweigh our right to life.” #NeverAgain

With an overwhelming majority of Americans supporting universal background checks, I do not understand how GOP leaders can continue to ignore this crisis. I continue to urge @SpeakerRyan to allow a vote on this issue. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/xIVZVGY48c
As co-chair of the Fire Services Caucus, I join in congratulating @IAFFNewsDesk on reaching their 100th anniversary. Thank you to the hardworking firefighters who put their lives on the line each and every day to protect communities in #MD05 and around the nation. #IAFF100Years https://t.co/NPMLFzZkYG
Glad to meet with @MDDCCUA this afternoon to discuss ways we can help Marylander consumers &amp; protect them from fraud. #CUNAGAC https://t.co/RhE5801UzU
A majority of Americans support action to #EndGunViolence. Congress ought to have the courage to take action and keep our people safe. Watch my full interview with @JohnBerman on @CNNnewsroom this morning: https://t.co/ZPplZJgFS6
Public employees deserve to benefit from collective bargaining just as private employees do. I hope #SCOTUS will agree fair-share fees are necessary to maintain the collective bargaining strength of labor organizations in #JanusvAFSCME.  https://t.co/adSHNtTkO8 #StandWithWorkers
Joined MD delegation in sending a letter to @SecretaryZinke to voice our strong opposition to @Interior plan to open up MD coasts to oil &amp; gas exploration. A potential spill would do extreme harm to the local environment, fisheries, &amp; tourism. https://t.co/q99vZDId3w
Honored to meet with @NeverAgainMSD students today. These are impressive, articulate young people who are changing the tenor of discussions about #gunviolence. I strongly urge the GOP to bring legislation to #EndGunViolence to the Floor for a vote. #MSDStrong #NeverAgain https://t.co/gqzfn6Ds4T
Properly vetting those who have access to our nation’s most sensitive intelligence is a matter of national security.

Just 2 months after the #GOPTaxScam was jammed through Congress, here’s a look at how companies are already seeing billions of dollars in profits - &amp; sharing them with wealthy investors - while most middle class Americans aren’t seeing any real benefit: https://t.co/kaJEblnP40
Take a look at the coverage of my 2nd #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour, which went to PA, OH, &amp; IN to hear from Americans about economic pressures they face, initiatives that have worked, &amp; persistent challenges that need to be addressed. https://t.co/SXWHahYw2d https://t.co/Brj1Nar0v7
Today on the Floor, the House will consider two bills, one of which seeks to combat online sex trafficking by providing new tools for law enforcement to prosecute criminal actor websites. https://t.co/RZg3YIBUut
I also said to reporters today that we have once again been confronted with the carnage of an assault weapon. If 97% of Americans agree we need universal background checks &amp; we cannot put a bill on the Floor, then what kind of democratic institution are we? #NeverAgain
Pleased to receive a 97% rating from @LCVoters on their annual Environmental Scorecard. We’ve worked hard to preserve #MD05’s most precious resources, &amp; I’m committed to preventing further attacks on our clean air &amp; water by the Trump Administration. https://t.co/A5iQZd7B4N https://t.co/JeTDM6TmcP
I told press today that @realDonaldTrump said he would sign a #DACA bill that Congress sends &amp; @SpeakerRyan says he will hold a vote on what POTUS will sign. Neither has happened. Both are being disingenuous. It’s time to put a bill on the Floor to #ProtectDREAMers.
At my weekly press conference, I discussed how the #GOPTaxScam overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy over the middle class. The skewing of resources to the wealthiest Americans is telling of the GOP’s priorities.
Today I told reporters about my 2nd #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour. This trip, I traveled to the Industrial Heartland to Pittsburgh, Toledo, &amp; Indy to discuss entrepreneurship, education &amp; skills training, &amp; infrastructure. This is what Americans want us focused on.
Congress has a responsibility to provide for the safety &amp; general welfare of Americans, including protecting our children from mass murderers. Proud to be an original cosponsor of @RepCicilline &amp; @RepTedDeutch’s bill to #BanAssaultWeapons. #NeverAgain https://t.co/t31M7VjHf0
Following today's #SCOTUS decision on #DACA, Dems will continue to insist on reaching a legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; provide them with a pathway to citizenship so that our communities can continue to benefit from their contributions. https://t.co/3agEL83a7V
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider 7 bills. https://t.co/KqvqoBg8J1

Republicans are touting news reports of companies offering bonuses for workers, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that the real winners under the #GOPtaxscam are corporate shareholders and the bonuses were just a fig leaf. Read today’s @NYTOpinion: https://t.co/KFKbe6Nb7K
Last week, I led the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour to Toledo, OH to discuss how to better equip American workers with skills needed to compete for jobs today &amp; prepare future generations for the jobs of the future. Thank you for hosting us, @RepMarcyKaptur. https://t.co/uhZ3r6bqyz

America’s foundation is defined by &amp; rooted in immigrants who came here seeking a better life. Deeply disappointed in @USCIS’s decision to remove “nation of immigrants” from its mission statement. This move denies our history &amp; contributions made by generations of immigrants.
I heard on the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour that @POTUS’s infrastructure proposal is not workable. It’s unfortunate that the President has not put forward a serious plan to fix roads, bridges, &amp; ports. We need to invest in 21st century infrastructure &amp; prepare for the future. https://t.co/oA9ZO15VZn
Thank you @USRepMikeDoyle, @RepMarcyKaptur, @RepAndreCarson, and @RepBarragan for participating in this week’s #ListeningTour. I look forward to traveling with more Members to communities around the country to talk about how to help all our people #MakeItInAmerica. 2/2

The Affordable Care Act’s consumer protections should apply to all who purchase coverage, &amp; every American deserves the chance to purchase affordable, quality health care coverage without facing discrimination. 3/3
Insurance companies could charge women higher rates than men for the same coverage, raise rates or deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, &amp; drop those who become sick. The presence of these plans in markets will cause premiums to go up for everyone else. 2/3
The Trump Admin is going after the heart of the #ACA: its consumer protections. Today’s proposed rule would allow companies to offer junk plans that cover little &amp; leave patients vulnerable to being denied access to basic benefits. https://t.co/kfovAKtkIn 1/3
Thank you @RepAndreCarson for hosting me today in #Indy as part of the second #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour. From learning about @IndyGoBus to hearing with local community leaders about critical infrastructure issues, it was an insightful day. https://t.co/czb7ZKr8AQ

Thank you for hosting the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour yesterday, @RepMarcyKaptur. I enjoyed hearing directly from Northwest Ohio’s employers and workers about how we can make workforce training more accessible for today’s workers &amp; the next generation. https://t.co/YGUzfPRYV1
This afternoon, I toured the control tower, viewed the radar system, &amp; joined a roundtable at @INDairport w @RepAndreCarson &amp; @RepBarragan to learn more about how #Indianapolis' investments in aviation infrastructure are helping the local economy &amp; creating jobs. #MakeItInAmerica https://t.co/FoZmk3Uakn
I heard time and time again today that investing in infrastructure is good for business. Local community leaders called on the federal government to remain involved in infrastructure as technology shifts. 7/7
I heard from community members doing a study on sustainability, resiliency, &amp; the city’s vulnerabilities when it comes to climate change, &amp; that Congress should look at what the country can do to prepare our infrastructure for the future rather than reacting to last disaster. 6/7
Another concern raised today in #Indy was about aging water and sewer infrastructure, a problem we see across the country. 5/7
Participants also discussed how infrastructure can help alleviate poverty so more people can #MakeItInAmerica. Improved public transit provides lower cost transit options &amp; jobs that can help Americans get out of poverty. 4/7
I heard public-private partnerships aren't a panacea. The debt from investments must be paid back, it’s not free money. 3/7
The @WhiteHouse infrastructure proposal asks for 80% of funding to come from local communities. I heard a unanimous "no" from the community when I asked if that was workable. 2/7
Today's #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour stop in #Indianapolis focused on infrastructure, which is key to creating jobs and strengthening our economic competitiveness. Here are some of my takeaways from the discussion with local leaders. 1/7
On Saturday, I toured @nrec_cmu w @USRepMikeDoyle &amp; learned about entrepreneurship &amp; robotics technology. We heard on the #ListeningTour that embracing innovation and rapidly changing technology will be key to ensuring businesses &amp; workers can #MakeItInAmerica. https://t.co/jVCERxVDzU
On the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour, I joined @RepAndreCarson &amp; @RepBarragan for a ride on the @IndyGoBus, the largest fleet of electric buses in the country. Local officials discussed how investments in new transit systems has helped create local jobs. https://t.co/Yhk01ZSh2n

With technology always changing, it’s important that workers have access to skills training throughout their careers. Roundtable participants said Congress can take steps to ensure that workers have access to continuing training so our workforce can stay competitive. 7/7
Another concern was that training for new skills is often expensive. What role can Congress play in ensuring that American workers have access to affordable skills training? One recommendation was investing in these programs instead of cutting them. 6/7
An interesting challenge brought up more than once at the education roundtable this morning is that children are presented with college as the only path post-high school. How can we change that? 5/7
In Toledo, I heard we ought to embrace technology and that we shouldn’t fear automation because American workers should build the robots that businesses will use. 4/7
Roundtable participants pointed out the best workers aren't always the best trainers. One suggestion I heard was to create partnerships between manufacturers and educators to ensure we have strong teachers who can prepare students. 3/7
Right now, there are jobs open across the United States but our workers are not trained to fill these roles. How can we close that gap? 2/7
We had a great discussion this morning during the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour in Toledo. We talked about the importance of ensuring that our workforce has the training necessary to be prepared for the jobs of the future. 1/7

No family should be torn apart like this, and our communities should not lose people like Jorge who are productive, law-abiding, tax-paying residents. Their story is why our nation must enact comprehensive immigration reform. I’m proud to stand with #TeamGarcia. 2/2

An important theme raised in all of our discussions about how we can help more businesses #MakeItInAmerica is mentorship. Entrepreneurs need mentors who have faced similar challenges and can help guide them. 5/5
For small business to succeed, they ought be able to export their products, which is a challenge for many small businesses. I want to see how the U.S. government can help ensure that businesses that #MakeitinAmerica can sell their products around the world. 4/5
We also discussed the importance of educating high school students about opportunities to pursue entrepreneurship. How can we help change the curriculum so students are aware of these opportunities? 3/5
In #Pittsburgh, we discussed the importance of access to quality, affordable health care for employees. 2/5
The #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour is underway &amp; I’ve heard from small business owners about barriers to success for entrepreneurs. 1/5

Follow along on the trip using the hashtags #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour. I look forward to hearing from our fellow citizens about economic pressures they face, initiatives that work, &amp; challenges that need to be addressed.
Many Americans believe that Congress is ignoring the economic insecurity they feel. The #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour tries to do things differently by getting out of Washington to listen to what they have to say in order to develop policies that address their concerns.

I am grateful to @BettyMcCollum04, @RepDonBeyer, @RepHuffman, @RepMcNerney, &amp; @RepJimmyGomez for speaking out today in opposition to President Trump’s #DirtyBudget. Dems are committed to protecting public health &amp; our environment from harmful budget cuts.
I reject the false choice presented in @realDonaldTrump’s #InfrastructureScam, which undermines public health &amp; environmental protections. America does not need to choose between building new infrastructure &amp; protecting the environment. We can, &amp; must, do both.
The #DirtyBudget released by the Trump Administration cuts 90% of the successful Chesapeake Bay Program at @EPA, harming Maryland’s public health, environment, &amp; economy and undermining efforts to #SaveTheBay. https://t.co/wbzULHcusF
The Administration’s #DirtyBudget eliminates thousands of @EPA positions on the front lines of the fight to safeguard our children &amp; grandchildren from harmful pollutants &amp; toxic substances.
It is unacceptable that President Trump’s #DirtyBudget cuts @EPA programs that help keep arsenic, lead, and mercury out of our drinking water &amp; air.  RT if you oppose @RealDonaldTrump’s #DirtyBudget https://t.co/4uHlTqICI7
Today, I join in urging Congressional Republicans to reject President Trump’s #DirtyBudget. This extreme budget undermines public health and our environment by slashing funding that helps keep our air and water clean &amp; preserve natural resources for future generations.
We have just four legislative days to #ProtectDREAMers.

It is time for @SpeakerRyan to let the people’s House work its will. He should put the immigration bills pending in this House on the Floor and let the majority rule. Retweet if you agree. https://t.co/SXk0ckz61a

H.R. 620 is a harmful bill that guts the Americans with Disabilities Act and must be defeated in the House. In the name of upholding the bedrock principles of civil rights law in this country and the integrity of the #ADA, we must #StopHR620. https://t.co/rAQx6Qj0Xg

The Broward County law enforcement &amp; first responders securing the scene &amp; treating victims deserve great praise for their courage &amp; professionalism.  I will be praying for the victims &amp; their families to have the strength to face the difficult days &amp; weeks ahead. 4/4
There should never be a wrong place, especially when that place is a school.  And there is never a wrong time for us to do what is right and tackle this challenge head-on. 3/4

I announced today that I will continue my #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour this weekend. I will visit Pittsburgh, Toledo, &amp; Indianapolis to hear directly from middle-class Americans about the economic challenges they face &amp; how Congress can ensure they can make it in America.
The @WhiteHouse infrastructure “proposal” is a fantasy &amp; assumes state &amp; local governments will bear the burden of modernizing our nation’s infrastructure. I told reporters it is another pie-in-the-sky proposal from @RealDonaldTrump.
Today when speaking with press, I said @RealDonaldTrump’s #TrumpBudget is none of the things he claims. It is inefficient, ineffective, irresponsible, &amp; irrelevant. It represents another broken promise to balance the budget – instead it explodes the deficit.
I’m deeply troubled the House is taking up H.R. 620, which undermines the Americans with Disabilities Act. I urge @SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOPLeader not to bring this bill to the Floor &amp; will join with disability &amp; civil rights advocates in fiercely opposing it. https://t.co/kbxRiCpHZ5

The #TrumpBudget doesn’t come close to balancing as a result of the #GOPTaxScam. With the tax law, Republicans blew a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy while sticking working families with the bill. RT if you think GOP is out of touch. https://t.co/Qzzkc8WviT
.@POTUS’ FY19 budget is unacceptable &amp; once again targets our hardworking federal civilian workforce. It also slashes funding for @NASAGoddard &amp; efforts to #SavetheBay, among other #MD05 priorities. This proposal is bad for MD &amp; our nation. https://t.co/Sx7CV9vSz2
.@RealDonaldTrump, @MickMulvaneyOMB—fixed your budget title for you. 
 
Budgets reflect priorities, &amp; this is a clear statement that this POTUS doesn’t prioritize fiscal sustainability; middle class workers &amp; their families; or investments in our economy. https://t.co/8pjxbAnwgc https://t.co/DC05cmZyaR
New report that the Trump Admin is seeking to keep the @FBI HQ in downtown DC is extremely alarming. Congress must reject this reckless proposal and look into why the Administration would make such a careless decision. https://t.co/KNgyxXU0qG
.@WhiteHouse infrastructure plan is not a serious plan to fix crumbling roads, bridges, airports, seaports, rail networks or to build 21st century infrastructure we need to grow the economy. I hope Congress can seek a better alternative. https://t.co/FgGfsAcsOs
#TrumpBudget sets up our economy to fail by bankrupting the country &amp; making it harder for private sector to invest in creating better-paying jobs. Congress should reject this approach &amp; work to apply commonsense principles of fiscal responsibility. https://t.co/8pjxbAnwgc

This action raises serious questions about what the President is trying to hide. After the President’s release of a one-sided, misleading memo written by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, it is only appropriate that Americans see all the facts. 2/2

Now that the threats of shutdown and default are gone, Congress must turn immediately to legislation allowing #DREAMers to remain here with a pathway to citizenship. Congress should have addressed this issue months ago. 2/2
This morning, America saw the utter dysfunction of the GOP, their inability to govern, &amp; failure to provide steady leadership. GOP controls all levers of our government &amp; are responsible for keeping it funded, yet they shut it down twice in one month. https://t.co/iDUfnN0pBx 1/2
A Republican Senator has held up passage of the bipartisan budget agreement all day. The Republican-led House is now waiting for votes between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. This is yet another example of Republicans’ inability to govern effectively.
With only hours to act &amp; avoid another #TrumpShutdown, I urge @SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOPLeader to bring to the Floor a one-day funding bill to keep the government open. Dems do not want to see govt shut down &amp; are prepared to vote for a one-day measure. https://t.co/zPiwCVqZfs

Today, when speaking with reporters, I held up a dollar and 50 cents &amp; discussed how out of touch it is for @SpeakerRyan to brag about that when the 1% will receive $1,191 a week. It’s another demonstration of the skewed priorities of the GOP.
Told press @HouseGOP is bringing another short-term funding bill to the Floor. We need a bipartisan budget agreement. We need to reauth health extenders in a bipartisan way, #protectDREAMers, &amp; pass disaster relief. Instead, the GOP keeps kicking the can down the road.
Today, I told reporters that the conduct of Chairman Nunes, in his writing and coordination of the deeply flawed #NunesMemo, smears law enforcement &amp; undermines the Russia investigation. @SenJohnMcCain put it best: “we are doing Putin’s job for him.”
Today, the House will consider a 5th stop-gap funding measure that kicks the can down the road instead of responsibly funding government &amp; addressing priorities, such as action to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; disaster relief. https://t.co/Fz7NAEz0qe

There is still more work that needs to be done. The Trump Admin has been undermining workers' rights since coming into office &amp; has done nothing to extend paid family &amp; medical leave or help families afford child care. I hope Dems &amp; the GOP will work together to change that. 2/2

I continue to be deeply concerned by the fiscal impact of the #GOPTaxScam. The @WashingtonPost reports a dramatic increase in borrowing under President Trump, which is on track to be the highest amount in 6 years, due to the tax law. https://t.co/V2fb5DIK47
Today is #GroundhogDay, and #PunxsutawneyPhil saw his shadow. I’m assuming @RealDonaldTrump did too, which means at least 6 more weeks — if not his entire presidency — of chaos and inaction on the issues Americans care most about. https://t.co/La9bYRVKRN

Doing so could result in a constitutional crisis of the kind not seen since the Saturday Night Massacre. https://t.co/dThwHkcmM0 https://t.co/Q7j4s11sGD
Chairman Nunes’s facilitation of this release and his altering of the memo was shameful and inappropriate.  That’s why I’ve urged the Speaker to #RemoveNunes. Congress must protect the Special Counsel’s investigation so that it can move forward unimpeded &amp; get to the truth. 2/2
POTUS chose to ignore the warnings from DOJ, FBI, &amp; intel community to release #NunesMemo to smear the law enforcement agencies investigating his campaign. Nobody has any doubts regarding what this is all about: undermining the Russia investigation.  https://t.co/raHAeSG7YE 1/2

Democrats remain focused on helping middle class get ahead.  While the GOP wastes their time pushing extreme partisan policies that put their wealthy donors first, Democrats will continue fighting for better wages, better benefits, and a better deal for working families. 2/2
Today’s #jobsreport shows that the work done during the Obama Admin to help the private sector grow jobs continues, if more slowly, under President Trump. But at a time when wages should be growing, this report shows weekly earnings fell in January. https://t.co/uSlmuR4tIs 1/2
I urge @SpeakerRyan to #RemoveNunes as Chair of the House Intel Cmte. Altering a classified memo after the Cmte’s vote is dishonest, violates House Rules, &amp; demonstrates the lengths he is willing to go undermine the rule of law in order to protect POTUS. https://t.co/tYbjX1LgeT

Russia’s attempts to subvert our democracy ought not to be a political game but rather an urgent bipartisan priority. 2/3
Yesterday, @CIA Director Pompeo said Russia will likely try to interfere in the 2018 elections. Instead of taking this threat to our democracy seriously, GOP is demonizing the @FBI &amp; sharing classified info that will put our national security at risk, all to protect @POTUS. 1/3

The Republican majority controls the House, Senate &amp; @WhiteHouse. They failed to fund the government, causing the #TrumpShutdown. Before February 8, Republicans must work with Democrats to resolve the issues at hand. They must not waste the next 17 days as they have the last 114. https://t.co/eWH3fcdGXS
While the Senate appears to have a deal to end the #TrumpShutdown, we must still resolve how we are going to responsibly fund government and address the issues on which we have agreement but Republicans refuse to bring to the Floor. https://t.co/XwNM6MR1B8
House Democrats stand ready to reopen the government. Thanks to @RepMarkPocan for calling on @HouseGOP to end the #TrumpShutdown by bringing my bill to the Floor. Unfortunately, the GOP refused. https://t.co/TFGohylq5T

Today, @RepTedLieu asked Republicans to end the #TrumpShutdown so Democrats and Republicans can work together to address our nation's priorities.

I also told reporters that we must take action this week to #ProtectDREAMers. Everyone agrees we should ensure DREAMers can stay here. We must reach agreement this week.
When speaking with reporters today, I said GOP is looking to kick the can down the road again with another short-term bill to fund govt. We must agree on a budget deal that adheres to parity as we always have.

Happy birthday to my friend, @RepVeasey. Thank you for your work on behalf of middle-class families in #TX33 and across the country as Co-Chair of the @BlueCollarDems.
Bipartisan former @DHSGov Secretaries agree that Congress must act as soon as possible to #ProtectDREAMers — not wait until March. Every day, #DREAMers are losing their protections, and I urge GOP leadership to allow a vote on the #DREAMActNow. https://t.co/maUA3d3b3q
The beginning of 2018 is an opportunity to reflect on the past year of unified Republican control of the government. Take a look at how, in every area, Republicans have failed to govern for the American people: https://t.co/wCb7N0v7zz

In spite of the fact that the GOP controls the House, Senate, &amp; White House, 2017 has been defined by chaos &amp; dysfunction. As the first session of the 115th Congress comes to a close, here’s a look at how unproductive &amp; closed the GOP-led Congress has been:https://t.co/CeRZJv3k8a
I will continue to fight for a fully-inclusive military &amp; strongly oppose @RealDonaldTrump’s harmful ban on transgender Americans in the military, which is inconsistent with our values &amp; harms national security. #ProtectTransTroops 2/2
Today marks 7 years since President Obama signed #DADT repeal allowing #LGBT Americans to serve openly in the military. I was proud, as Majority Leader, to bring that legislation to the Floor &amp; help end this discriminatory ban. 1/2

I agree with children’s health care advocates who are calling on GOP leadership to enact a long-term, bipartisan reauthorization of #CHIP.  Families across the country deserve certainty that their children will have health coverage. Instead, the GOP is putting coverage at risk. https://t.co/sr5ddTtmdv

Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and an outstanding new Member in the Maryland delegation, @RepRaskin. Thanks for serving as a Senior Whip on my Whip team.
Happy birthday to Assistant Whip and Co-Chair of the Rebuilding America Task Force, @DonaldNorcross.
I joined the @HouseBlueDogs today to discuss how the @HouseGOP’s tax bill would worsen the national debt. While we’re for tax reform, we’re for fiscally responsible, revenue-neutral tax reform. https://t.co/UsSXzljkFt https://t.co/29wfDowqut
Joined @WaysMeansCmte for a hearing that @HouseGOP has refused to hold.

This week is the last week of open enrollment for Americans to #GetCovered on https://t.co/Dz993zU0mD. I told reporters Republicans ought to abandon their relentless campaign to sabotage Americans’ access to health care.
Told press these priorities must be addressed in a bipartisan fashion before the end of the year. There’s no further time to fiddle while Rome burns; there’s no further time to allow uncertainty to prevail just because GOP wants tax cuts for the rich. 2/2

Happy birthday to my good friend, @RepGutierrez, who has been a lifelong advocate for comprehensive immigration reform &amp; a strong voice in Congress for #OurFellowAmericans in Puerto Rico.
This updated figure comes two months after @RealDonaldTrump insensitively claimed that Puerto Ricans ought to be ‘very proud’ that the death toll wasn’t higher and after he said the storm was not ‘a real catastrophe.’ He ought to apologize. 2/2

@NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump To diminish our commitment to protecting the natural landscapes and historic places of this country from ruin by exploitation or pollution would constitute a breach of our responsibility both to those who founded this nation and those who will inherit it. 3/4
@NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump America is not America without its great outdoor spaces, its national parks, and historic monuments that Congress and past presidents have preserved for the benefit of generations to come. 2/4

With over 60% of the benefits of the #GOPTaxScam going to the top 1% of Americans, it’s no wonder middle-class Americans are skeptical of the GOP bill. I urge Republicans to listen to the public and abandon this proposal.

I urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose the #GOPTaxScam. I hope they will do the right thing and reject this bill.
The #GOPTaxScam cannot be called bipartisan. The last time we rewrote our tax code was truly bipartisan, permanent tax reform. We did it together &amp; in a way that was paid for. https://t.co/jNzfOCj4AS
The #GOPTaxScam is not a tax cut and it’s not a jobs plan. The bill would add $1.7 trillion in added debt, meaning it would cost taxpayers $1.9 million for each job the GOP claims it would create. https://t.co/iuAuRJJlU6
On top of that, the Senate #GOPTaxScam would kick 13 million Americans off of their insurance coverage, putting further strain on our economy. https://t.co/53vEYvyGUi
Somehow, the Senate GOP achieved a worse plan for middle-class households – increasing taxes on 82 million middle-class families. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/FsM0fT2pC9

Today, 227 @HouseGOP Members voted to raise taxes on 36 million middle-class households &amp; to add at least $1.7 trillion to our national debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy. This is not tax reform; it’s a #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/k2eOXOVcFW 1/2

I said to press today, to vote on #TrumpCare this week would be a travesty to the American people &amp; promises for transparency.
I told press the House and Senate #TrumpCare bills are “mean” and “meaner.” This is bad policy, bad process, and bad politics.
Today I told press that @USCBO score confirms Senate #TrumpCare bill falls short of @realDonaldTrump's promise of "insurance for everybody."
I agree, @JohnKasich. @USCBO score confirms #TrumpCare will force Americans to #PayMoreForLess. I urge the Senate to reject this bill. https://t.co/fHmG3BGkdB
.@MHAonline &amp; @AARPMD agree: #TrumpCare would make Maryland’s health care system "less secure and less affordable." https://t.co/A8yULmJI1y
Kicking 22M Americans off their insurance is a pretty odd definition of #BetterCare https://t.co/sRZIMnI5Qu
.@USCBO says if you are 64 &amp; have a silver plan under the #ACA now, premiums for that plan under #TrumpCare triple. #PayMoreForLess
If you are 64 and middle class, if you pay $6,800 for a plan now, you could pay $20,500 for the same plan under #TrumpCare #PayMoreForLess
If you are 40 years old and making $11,400/year, you could pay nearly half that - $5,500 - for health care under #TrumpCare #PayMoreForLess
What does #TrumpCare mean for low-income Americans? @USCBO says premiums &amp; deductibles could reach nearly 50% of annual income.
#TrumpCare would be devastating for Marylanders – more than 207,000 would lose private insurance &amp; average premiums would increase $742 https://t.co/e9wbPLNoHE

No one, including Clinton, should ever face meddling from foreign government https://t.co/bMKOAGVQAw
The findings of Robert Mueller's investigation must be taken seriously at every level of government, and he must be allowed to investigate without any interference from the White House or Congress.
Mueller's indictment provides further evidence that the Russian government interfered in 2016. It also shows that they tried to turn my supporters against Hillary Clinton in the primary and general election. I unequivocally condemn such interference.
The key issues now are: 

1) How we prevent the unwitting manipulation of our electoral and political system by foreign governments.
2) Exposing who was actively consorting with the Russian government’s attack on our democracy.
As someone who campaigned hard for Hillary Clinton from one end of this country to another, it is an outrage that she had to run against not only Donald Trump but also the Russian government.
What the Russians did in the 2016 election cycle deserves unconditional condemnation. That includes all of their conduct - whether it was active support of any candidate or active opposition to any candidate.
RT @sxsw: Senator @BernieSanders will sit down with @CNN's @jaketapper for a conversation at #SXSW 2018! https://t.co/36K5eOxi9Y https://t.…
It is absolutely imperative that the Mueller investigation be allowed to go forward without obstruction from the Trump administration or Congress.
It has been clear to everyone (except Donald Trump) that Russia was deeply involved in the 2016 election and intends to be involved in 2018. It is the American people who should be deciding the political future of our country, not Mr. Putin and the Russian oligarchs.

A great nation is not judged its number of billionaires or the tax breaks they get. It's judged by how we treat the most vulnerable.
When workers in West Virginia have two or three jobs to stay alive, you don’t take away their health care to give billionaires tax breaks.
West Virginia’s overdose death rate is the highest in the U.S. We need more funding to address the crisis—not nearly $800B in Medicaid cuts.
What kind of country are we when anyone could think about cutting help to disabled kids in order to give tax breaks to billionaires?
This legislation is fatally flawed. No small tweak here or there will undo the massive damage it will cause to West Virginia and the nation.
How can you draft a bill of such enormous magnitude without one public comment from experts who are most knowledgeable about health care?
@SenCapito: In America we’re not supposed to take from the most vulnerable people in order to give massive tax breaks to billionaires.

We will not allow Republicans to punish the elderly, children, the sick and the poor, while they reward their billionaire friends.
At a time of grotesque income inequality, the rich do not need more tax breaks and working people do not need cuts to basic needs.
This is no time for despair or giving up. This is a time for organizing, educating and fighting back.
The struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. It must be fought by every generation.
Obamacare isn’t perfect. But the solution is not to throw millions off health care without a replacement plan and say, “You're on your own."
When Trump and his friends make delusional statements about "voter fraud," they are setting the stage for an increase in voter suppression.
Our job today: strengthen Obamacare and stop the repeal. Tomorrow, we must join the rest of the world and guarantee health care for all.
If you're rich and powerful and commit illegal behavior you get promoted to the president's cabinet. There’s something very wrong with that.
Our nation worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don’t believe that is the nation we should be living in.
It appears Mr. Trump, who attacks media that makes critical remarks about him as “fake news,” doesn't understand what democracy is about.
Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 20 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.
25 states and cities raised minimum wages last year. How is that possible? Because millions of people stood up to fight.
Our diversity is our strength. We must take pride in that, not let hatred divide us.
I would hope that Republicans have the courage to stand up to Trump's movement to authoritarianism.
Trump: Want to know what fake news is? Your denial of climate change and the lies spread by fossil fuel companies to protect their profits.
According to Trump, if you want the truth, ignore everything except what he is saying. That's what totalitarianism is all about. https://t.co/JFwpMpLj3u

Instead of draining the swamp, Trump is filling it up with the same old Wall Street insiders, whose greed nearly destroyed our economy.
Talk about cowardice. Republicans are trying to ram through Pruitt's confirmation before the American people find out what is in his emails.
We need an EPA administrator whose priority is the safety of people, not the profits of the fossil fuel industry. Pruitt is not that person.
Scientists are virtually unanimous that climate change is real and caused by human activity. Mr. Pruitt refuses to recognize that.

We need a Labor Secretary who will stand up for workers, raising the minimum wage &amp; pay equity for women. Mr. Puzder was not that candidate.
We need to know if President Trump's foreign policy represents the best interests of this country or the best interests of Russia.
Our job: Break up the major financial institutions, not appoint more Wall Street executives to the administration as Trump has done.
Our job is to grow the trade union movement so that workers, white collar and blue collar, can stand up and fight for their rights.
Trump old workers he would stand up for them and stand up to Wall Street. Now, the same old Wall Street insiders are running the show.
What I say to the American people is: stay focused. We will fight for an economy that works for all and doesn’t just benefit the wealthy.
We’ve got to bring people together around a progressive agenda. They want to raise the minimum wage and make health care a right.
Trump is a total hypocrite. He campaigned saying I'm going to take on Wall Street, and then he hires the president of Goldman Sachs.
When Donald Trump attacks the  media as “fake news” what he is doing is trying to move our country in an authoritarian direction.
Our job is to stand together, vigorously oppose Trump's racist immigration policies and fight for policies that work for working families.
Whether it is in conservative parts of the country or in progressive areas, the American people are fighting back. https://t.co/xIhj3j0MbM
Trump has sent many tweets the last few months. But where's the tweet saying he’ll keep his promise to not cut Medicare and Medicaid?
We need an Attorney General who’ll defend the Constitution &amp; educate the president about what it means. Jeff Sessions won't be that person.

In the midst of massive wealth inequality, @tedcruz doesn't just want to take away health care, he wants to give huge tax breaks to the 1%.
We're having an absurd discussion for the wealthiest nation. We are talking about taking health care away from 30 million people.
A Medicare-for-all system would save us hundreds of billions in health care costs a year. It’s financially smart and the moral thing to do.

President Trump's ban on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries is un-American, unconstitutional and will not make us more safe.
The American people are settling in for a long and sustained fight to defend democracy and the values which have made us a great county.
We believe in a nation based on economic, social, racial and environmental justice and we've just begun to fight back.
We should be looking for guidance now not from pollsters and political consultants, but from leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr.
Given Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional actions, the Democratic Party can no longer do politics "as usual."
Putting Steve Bannon, an extreme right-wing operative, on the National Security Council is dangerous and he should be removed.
We say to @realDonaldTrump: Rescind the Muslim ban!
The American people want real change, a change based on compassion and justice, not hatred, intolerance and divisiveness.
Republicans say they want to get government off people's backs, except, of course, if you are a woman who wants to control her own body.
Trump claimed he would stand up for working people, but it turns out Goldman Sachs is still running the show.

We cannot stay silent and watch the GOP dismantle the health care system and jeopardize the economic security of millions of Americans.
Some politicians still refuse to recognize the reality of climate change. It's 2017. That's a disgrace.

Fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. That is just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible.
The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the country. That should not be the case when people’s lives are at stake.
Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 30 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.
Cities and towns and states have stepped up and raised the minimum wage to $15. It’s about time that Congress does the same for all workers.
You cannot be a party which takes money from Wall Street and then tells working families you are on their side. People see through that.
The U.S. shouldn’t discourage kids who want to go to college with massive costs. We should be educating as many people as we possibly can.
Our goal must be to improve the VA, not destroy it. We will vigorously oppose any and all efforts to privatize the VA.
While other nations are guaranteeing health care as a right, we spend more on our military than the next seven nations combined.
I wish elected officials would spend less time making it harder for people to vote and more time fighting for the working class.
Members of Congress spend way too much time in pursuit of money and too little time actually debating the issues.

The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies, not politicians.

If Mr. Trump tries to pursue discriminatory policies, he should remember that a majority of voters did not support him and his bigotry.
We are rapidly moving toward a nation of the super-rich, by the super-rich and for the super-rich.
Believing in climate change is not optional at this point. Neither is taking action to save the planet.
Garnishing social security benefits to pay off student debt is a clear example of why we need fundamental changes in our national priorities
It is beyond absurd that so many bright young people are unable to attend college because of the cost.
We are moving toward an oligarchic form of society, and it will take all of us to fight against it.
Clinton received almost 3 million more votes, but Trump will be the next president. It's clear the electoral college needs to be changed.
Lowering prices on prescription drugs—that is, making sure that people can afford to live—should not be a partisan issue.
Every person in this country deserves a decent opportunity and a decent standard of living. Until that happens we will not truly be free.
It would be nice to put off worrying about climate change for a few decades. But the truth is we have no choice but to act now.
We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.
The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.
Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
Cuts to life and death programs like Medicare and massive tax breaks for the wealthy—that's not what America is supposed to be about.
Even though the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana, a black person is almost 4x more likely to be arrested for possession.
Walmart costs taxpayers $6.2 billion every year in public assistance programs by not paying their workers a living wage. That is insane.
Congress must begin listening to the majority of Americans who do not want cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.
Our job is to grow the union movement so that anyone working 40 hours a week, whether it’s in a factory or a hotel, doesn't live in poverty.
A small subsection of the one percent are hell-bent on doing everything in their power to block action against climate change.
Young people in this country should be in good schools and at good jobs, not in jail cells.
There is hatred being generated against immigrants in this country. We've got to stand together and reject that hate.

If we beat the drug industry in California we are going to put them on the defensive and lower the cost of medication across this country.
High drug prices isn’t just about people dying, it’s about people having to go deeply into debt to get the medication they need.
Drug companies make huge profits and executives get big compensation package, while Americans die because they can't afford their medication
If you want to understand why we pay such high drug prices listen to this: Since 1998 the drug industry has spent $3 billion on lobbying.
While millions of Americans cannot afford the medication they need, last year the 5 major drug corporations made $50 billion in profit.

How serious is Trump about fixing the trade problem? From (now-defunct) Trump University: "Outsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Run."
Wanna know why Trump believes wages are too high in the U.S.?  He is used to paying 30 cents an hour in low-wage countries abroad.

Every American over 18 must be automatically registered to vote so that young people can make their voices heard at the ballot box.
We must put an end to discriminatory laws and the purging of minority-community names from voting rolls.
Change comes when the people demand it — in the voting booth and on the streets in peaceful demonstrations.
We must remember that the struggle for our rights is not the struggle of a day, or a year. It is the struggle of a lifetime.
When the votes of minorities are suppressed, it becomes easier for politicians who represent billionaires to win and hold elected office.
I have a message for Donald Trump: No, we’re not going to hate Latinos or Muslims. We are going to stand together.
Make no mistake: the billionaire class does not want young and working people to vote.
In the shameful days of open segregation, literacy laws were used to suppress minority voting. Today, Republicans do it with photo ID laws.
Through a Prize Fund we can provide affordable access to medicines as soon as they are available on the market.
The prices of patented medicines are a significant barrier to access to health for millions Americans and people die because of it.
It should offend the conscience of every American when the votes of minorities are suppressed.

Poverty should not be a death sentence, neither in the United States nor anywhere else.  Yet it is, much to our disgrace.
We will defeat Donald Trump because we know that love trumps hatred.

It’s fun for the media to treat Trump like a character in a soap opera, but the truth is his language is dangerous.
In my view, it makes a lot more sense to be investing in jobs and education, than more jails and incarceration.
We must once again make our country the leader in the fight for economic and social justice, for environmental sanity and for peace.
If @realDonaldTrump wants to open the door to racism, it is our job to shut that door, and shut it tight.
The greed of the billionaire class is destroying this country and whether they like it or not we are going to stop that greed.
I believe we have a moral obligation to pursue diplomatic solutions before resorting to military intervention.
Trump suggested limiting immigration according to religion and creating a national database based on religion – absolutely disgraceful.
To advance the cause of peace, the United States has also got to be a friend not only to Israel, but to the Palestinian people.
We have got to say to the fossil-fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.
At a time of massive inequality, the Republicans believe that the richest people in America need to be made even richer.
I hope the Republicans listen to what the Pope has to say. Denying the science related to climate change is no longer acceptable.

I'm asking people across the nation to come together and organize an unprecedented grassroots movement.
Together we're going to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision which has allowed millionaires to buy politicians.
Despite what the media tells you, politics is not a soap opera. Politics is about coming together to improve the lives of all.
We need a grassroots movement to tell the Koch brothers and the billionaire class that they won't be able to continue to buy elections.
We are building a movement because this country belongs to all of us - not just a handful of billionaires and wealthy campaign contributors.
No president alone can effectively address the crises facing the working families of this country without a powerful grassroots movement.
At what point will Congress have the courage to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and say enough is enough?

We spend $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million Americans, disproportionately African-American, Latino and Native-American. #NALEOConf16
Trump's divisive rhetoric is unacceptable and must be rejected. We don’t need a wall and barbed wire; we need to fix our immigration system.
I have seen the sadness of families torn apart by a broken immigration system in the United States. This human suffering has got to end.

The Democratic Party needs a 50-state strategy. We may not win in every state tomorrow but we must provide resources to these states.
Sadly, the current Democratic leadership has turned its back on dozens of states and allowed right-wing politicians to win elections.
We must resist all efforts to cut Social Security. Instead, we've gotta fight to expand benefits for our seniors and disabled veterans.
The greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street has got to end. It's up to us to end it for them.
We must defeat the Trans-Pacific Partnership and make certain that it does not get a vote in a lame-duck session of Congress.
From Flint, Michigan to California we have communities unable to drink the polluted water that comes out of their faucets. In the year 2016.
The reality is that today millions of our fellow Americans are working at starvation wages.
Our brave young men and women in the military should not thrown into perpetual warfare in wars we should not be fighting.
Health care is a right, not a privilege. It's time for the United States to implement a single-payer system like Medicare for all.
We must ban fracking if we want to protect our water supply.
It’s not very hard to understand that potential terrorists, criminals and the dangerously mentally ill should not have access to guns.

In many inner cities, kids now stand a greater chance of ending up in jail than ending up with a college degree. That's gotta end.
We must compete effectively in a global economy by making public colleges and universities tuition-free.
We must end the disgrace of having more people in jail than any other country on earth and move toward real criminal justice reform.
We must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right and not a privilege.
Current leadership has allowed right-wing politicians to win elections in some states with virtually no opposition. https://t.co/2YY2aZ5jOz
We must pass comprehensive immigration reform and provide a path toward citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
We must ensure that women will no longer make 79 cents on the dollar compared to men and that we fight for pay equity.
We must fight to make certain that women throughout the country have the right to control their own bodies.
Bernie supporters want to run for office in: 
🐦 51% of state house districts 
🐦 69% of state senate districts &amp;
🐦 every U.S. House district.
If we are serious about criminal justice reform, we must remove marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act.
I find it strange that the kid who smokes marijuana gets arrested but the crooks on Wall Street get off scot free.
As I have said throughout this campaign, the Democratic Party must support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
We must ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons, end the gun show loophole and expand instant background checks.
My hope is that when future historians look back on the campaign of 2016 they will say that is where it all began. Thank you #OurRevolution

Over 15 million children in America today are poor — more than 20 percent of all of the kids living in America today.

Some of us believe that what God teaches is to not turn our backs on our brothers and our sisters, that essentially we are in this together.
Our economy works for Wall Street because it’s rigged by Wall Street. As long as Washington's bought, our economy won't work for the people.
Universal health care is an idea that has been supported by Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman.
We must lead the world in working with China, Russia, India and the international community to break our energy dependence on fossil fuel.
Millions of lives are being wrecked, families are being torn apart and we are spending huge sums of taxpayer money by locking people up.
We must not succumb to bigotry. We must do what we do best as Americans – fight racism, fight xenophobia and fight fear.
A job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage.

I'm horrified by yesterday's terrorist attack in Tel Aviv. My thoughts are with the victims' families and all of those harmed.
The American people know that it is not acceptable that the top tenth of 1 percent owns as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
Our mission is more than just defeating Trump. It is transforming our country. People want something to vote for rather than just against.
The American people will never support a candidate whose major theme is bigotry. We will not allow Donald Trump to become president.
We will not allow right-wing Republicans to control our government. That is especially true with Donald Trump as the Republican candidate.
Young people understand that they are the future of America, and they intend to help shape that future.
We have won 22 state elections with over 11 million votes and in virtually every state, we've won in big numbers the votes of young people.
When we began this campaign we were considered to be a fringe campaign. Over the last year, I think that has changed just a little bit.
We must always remember that change almost never happens from the top down, it happens from the bottom up.

Hillary Clinton worked to export fracking throughout the world to reward companies like Chevron and Halliburton. That is unacceptable.

Sec. Clinton does not support a ban on fracking. Instead, she would simply impose a few more regulations on it. Not good enough.
We need to implement a nationwide ban on fracking – period. And, that’s exactly what I will fight for as president.
We need to put an end to fracking all over this country. Tune in to our press conference on fracking: https://t.co/lbQGAWTQrH
If I am elected president we will work together on a nationwide ban on fracking.

Secretary Clinton and I have differences of opinion on many issues. In no area are our differences stronger than fracking.

I do think that we can fulfill the legacy of presidents F.D.R., Truman, and L.B.J. and guarantee health care for all people as a right.
Every day, the corporate-controlled media and the political establishment tell us: think small. Well, you know what? We're gonna think big.
It makes no sense to continue to spend far more per capita than do the people of any other nation on health care and get far worse outcomes.
How does it happen that the United States is the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right?
The Affordable Care Act, which I helped write, has done some good things. But even with those improvements, we have got to do more.

That's just a "single issue" where @HillaryClinton and I differ.
In my view, we need to repeal the 1996 welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net.
In 2008, @HillaryClinton said that “welfare should not be an anti-poverty program.” I disagree.
This legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. That is unacceptable.
This legislation gave Republican governors like Scott Walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need.
In 1994, welfare provided a vital safety net to more than 14 million Americans. Today, it only helps 4.4 million.
Families LIVING IN POVERTY receiving cash benefits:
1996: 68%
2014: Only 23%
From 1996 to 2011, households living in EXTREME poverty increased 182% for African Americans; 132% for Hispanics; 109% for White Americans.
The number of children in extreme poverty has skyrocketed from 1.4 million to 3.5 million.
It established strict work requirements for receiving benefits and severely limited access to benefits for undocumented people.
Since this legislation was signed into law, families living in extreme poverty have more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.65 million.
It turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster.
Unfortunately, @HillaryClinton supported this bill calling it “a critical first step to reforming our nation’s welfare system.”
I called that bill “an assault on the poor, women and children, minorities, and immigrants.” I believed that then and I believe that now.
One of the biggest differences between the Clintons and myself in this campaign is our view on welfare reform.

Despite the fact that the wealthiest 1% in America already hold almost 40% of the country's net wealth, the GOP has decided that they're the ones who need a tax break. https://t.co/qEvO8vYxdE  - @lornamaejohnson

The GOP said this tax plan was going to help working folks, but in reality, millionaires, billionaires, and corporations are the ones who are getting most of the benefits, while working Americans are left scraping the bottom of the barrel. - @lornamaejohnson
I've spent my career in health care — I'm a midwife by trade — and for years, I've been a small-business owner. I'm dismayed with how the GOP has used their tax "plan" to hurt working Americans, many of them women, to give tax breaks to the rich. - @lornamaejohnson

.@desmondmeade and his volunteers have collected 1.1 million signatures to get rights restoration on the Nov. ballot, and now they are working to get out the vote. - @TeamKCP
As the head of Floridians for Fair Democracy he is working to change Florida’s restoration of rights process and give the right to vote back to hundreds of thousands of people who have served their time. - @TeamKCP #IWillVote
Get Out the Vote is our last pillar. @desmondmeade lost his voting rights after being convicted of a felony, but now he’s fighting for fellow Floridians to get their rights back. - @TeamKCP #IWillVote
.@SpreadtheVoteUS works to get photo IDs for people in voter ID states who can’t get them themselves. Kat: “Don't let voter suppression stop your voice from being heard. Get an ID and get to the polls." - @TeamKCP #IWillVote
.@KatCalvinLA and her organization @SpreadTheVoteUS are continuing this work today. She is a lawyer who was inspired to start Spread the Vote after seeing the devastating effects of voter ID laws. - @TeamKCP
The third pillar: Protect the Vote. Thelton Henderson is a former Northern CA U.S. District Judge &amp; was the first black attorney in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division in the early 1960’s to investigate civil and voting rights violations by local law enforcement agencies. - @TeamKCP
The 3 of them recently launched #wakandathevote, a nationwide voter registration drive held at movie theaters showing Black Panther. Now that’s a great example of activists meeting people where they are and creating change! - @TeamKCP #IWillVote
In October 2017, @iKaylaReed , @JessicaLBYRD , and @RukiaLumumba launched the Electoral Justice Project as part of the Movement for Black Lives with the goal of registering and mobilizing Black political power. - @TeamKCP #IWillVote
Rev. George Washington Lee was martyred for registering voters in Mississippi in 1955. Lee had tried for years to register to vote, and, when he finally succeeded, he worked tirelessly to help others defeat barriers to the ballot box. - @TeamKCP
The next pillar of our #IWillVote program: Register to vote. Even after the 15th Amendment gave Black Americans the vote, Jim Crow laws prevented many Black people from even registering to vote for nearly 100 years. - @TeamKCP
When Black voters commit to turning up on Election Day, amazing things happen. @KeishaBottoms and @LaToyaForNOLA were just elected mayors of Atlanta and New Orleans because they were able to engage our community in meaningful ways. - @TeamKCP https://t.co/M7pFJmHdlU
Then-U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions tried to stop them. In 1985 Evelyn &amp; Albert were falsely accused of altering absentee ballots. Sessions’ long history of racism was on full display: the case against them was weak, and they were found not guilty. - @TeamKCP
Evelyn &amp; Albert Turner exemplify the first of our pillars: Commit to vote. By helping people vote with their absentee ballots, they were able to elect candidates to the school board and county commission in AL. - @TeamKCP #IWillVote
The 4 pillars of our #IWillVote program are Commit to Vote, Register to Vote, Protect the Vote, and Get Out the Vote. While Trump and his cronies create fake commissions to investigate problems that don’t exist, these activists are on the ground doing real work. - @TeamKCP

Black women have been voting to represent their best interests as Democrats more fiercely and more consistently than any other voting bloc. We cannot and will not take them for granted! - @Sewell4Congress
Doug Jones is a wonderful man and was a terrific candidate who would not have won without the turnout we saw from black voters — black women in particular. - @Sewell4Congress
Support from black women was key in last month's VA gov race, where Democrat Ralph Northam brought home a big W. And no other voting bloc supported New Jersey Gov-elect Phil Murphy at higher %s than black women. - @Sewell4Congress
And you know what? This isn’t a new thing. Black women vote. - @Sewell4Congress
Think about that. Descendants of Alabamians who once faced literacy tests and had to guess how many marbles were in a jar in order to vote, stood up against hatred and intolerance and made the difference at the ballot box. - @Sewell4Congress
The defeat of Roy Moore wasn’t about right vs. left. It was about right vs. wrong. Selma came through. And so did a Hell of a lot of black women. - @Sewell4Congress
My heart almost burst with joy to know that Selma — home of the sacred ground where Freedom Fighters were bloodied and beaten for the right to vote — Selma, helped seal the deal for Doug Jones in last night's #ALSenate election! - @Sewell4Congress
@Sewell4Congress Decades later I sought office for the U.S. House and became the first black woman to ever serve in Alabama's Congressional delegation where I presently represent Selma, Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, and more. - @Sewell4Congress
@Sewell4Congress I knew that black women could change the world long before the incredible headlines we're seeing today. My mom, a high school librarian with a master’s degree, became the first African-American woman elected to Selma’s City Council and served 11 years. - @Sewell4Congress
Hello, Twitter! Congresswoman Terri Sewell here. I'll be taking over tweet duty for @TheDemocrats over the next little bit for some real talk on last night's big #ALSen win and the power of the #blackwomen vote! - @Sewell4Congress

This National Voter Registration Day let's recommit to dismantling barriers to the ballot box and get #VoteReady! -Rep. John Lewis
In order to ensure America’s government reflects our values, each and every one of us must play a role in shaping it. -Rep. John Lewis
And we too cannot stand by. We must stand up, speak up, and speak out for what's right. We all must register to vote. -Rep. John Lewis
The courage of the young people in the Civil Rights Movement was not divine or innate. They made a choice to take action. -Rep. John Lewis
I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Alabama for the right to vote. -Rep. John Lewis
Never forget that those who marched from Selma to Montgomery were just ordinary people with an extraordinary vision. -Rep. John Lewis
Many were harassed, jailed, beaten, and some were even killed for trying to participate in the democratic process. -Rep. John Lewis
Before the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, it was almost impossible for some citizens to register and vote. -Rep. John Lewis
We’re too quiet. There's too much at stake. No one can afford to stay silent or stay on the side-lines. -Rep. John Lewis
The right to vote – a right that many people bled for and died to secure – is under attack in America. -Rep. John Lewis
The Democratic Party believes our country is stronger when more people can participate in our elections, not fewer. -Rep. John Lewis
The right to vote is precious and almost sacred. It’s the most powerful, nonviolent tool or instrument in our democracy. -Rep. John Lewis

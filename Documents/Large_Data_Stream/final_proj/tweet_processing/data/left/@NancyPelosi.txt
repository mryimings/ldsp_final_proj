When we #ProtectDreamers, we honor the highest ideals of America. Their patriotism, their perseverance, their optimism are an inspiration that stirs the conscience of our entire nation. https://t.co/3hrtOthbU4
This fight is not over. While I am disappointed that @SpeakerRyan lacks the courage lift the shadow of fear from these inspiring young ppl, I have hope.
Democrats worked hard to achieve bipartisan agreement &amp; assured @SpeakerRyan we weren’t interested in shutting down government. He responded need by refusing to a make real commitment to hold a vote to #ProtectDreamers
Republicans are celebrating the passage of their fifth stop-gap, short term Continuing Resolution on the heels of their second shutdown in a month — continuing government by dysfunction. #GOPshutdown

Fernando is exactly the kind of young person America should be embracing. And he’s not alone. Across the nation, #DREAMers are contributing to &amp; strengthening our communities. America cannot afford to have Republicans continue to push them away.
Now a third year medical student at @UCSF, Fernando is contributing to research to fight many diseases and disorders.
Fernando was brought to the US when he was 9 yrs old. He was an AP scholar, received the IB Diploma, an Achievement Award in Foreign Language for French, and graduated cum laude from @SantaClaraUniv with a double major in Biology and French. He is undocumented.
The fight to #ProtectDREAMers will have impacts in communities all across America. Right in my district, a young man named Fernando is just one of many whose future hangs in the balance.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump I promise you: this fight is not over. Hatred will never defeat #pride – both of country &amp; of living your life as your true self.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Like all who wear the uniform, their willingness to risk their lives to protect our families &amp; our communities should be honored.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Our #trans service members are patriots doing their part to defend our freedom – not some burden to be cast aside.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump But instead of honoring their patriotism, @POTUS has decided to attack their dignity and the very value of their service.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Transgender Americans have proudly – if silently – served in our military for years.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump It is disgusting to see transgender service members insulted and devalued for a hateful political agenda.
@POTUS .@realDonaldTrump’s decision to ban transgender Americans from the military is a vile attack on brave individuals defending our country.

Without health coverage, giving birth costs an average of $30,000 – or $50,000 for a C-section delivery. We must fight to #ProtectOurCare!

The only decent thing for Republicans to do is pull their #PayMoreForLess bill from consideration before it hurts the American people.

How many will suffer under this #RxForDisaster? Republicans are clearly afraid of the answer. https://t.co/3XiuavfqS6
So I have to ask: who really is failing the transparency test here? (hint: it's not the Democrats)
On the other hand, Republicans seem to have forgotten they hid the #RxForDisaster in the Capitol basement last week.
And the #ACA is stronger because of that input.
(That’s not even counting the thousands of calls, emails, and letters we received)
Outside Washington, @HouseDemocrats held 3,000 town halls and events to hear from our constituents on the bill.
And the bill was posted for *30 days* before the first committee held a vote on ACA.
239 amendments from both Dems and Republicans were considered. 121 ended up being accepted.
Members talked with over 181 witnesses (both D&amp;R) during nearly 100 hours of hearings.
There were 79 hearings and markups in 2009 &amp; 2010 on the ACA.

(Those were bipartisan meetings, for the record)
The truth? ACA resulted from one of the most transparent drafting processes in recent memory.
Word of advice to the White House: stick to reality. Health care is a big deal and we can’t afford any #alternativefacts.
Sec. Price seems confused. He *says* he wants  “patient care” – but the #RxForDisaster he’s pushing would kick 11 million off Medicaid.
Americans deserve to know how the GOP’s #RxForDisaster will affect their families. Read my letter here: https://t.co/TYPJmRqBf2
47 days into his presidency, @realDonaldTrump has done nothing to create jobs -- but he's finding time to #MakeAmericaSickAgain.

If there is an attempt to silence us for commonsense gun violence prevention, w/ Gabby Giffords as our witness, we will stand our ground.
We'll continue to protect clean air and clean water, women's rights, LGBT rights, civil rights, and our DREAMers &amp; their immigrant families.
Yet every American should know: if there's any attempt to destroy Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security or ACA, we will stand our ground.
We have the responsibility and the power to lift the lives and the hopes of the American people.
To @POTUS and @VP: thank you for your counsel and for all you have given to America.

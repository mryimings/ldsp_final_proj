In October 2017, @iKaylaReed , @JessicaLBYRD , and @RukiaLumumba launched the Electoral Justice Project as part of the Movement for Black Lives with the goal of registering and mobilizing Black political power. - @TeamKCP #IWillVote
Rev. George Washington Lee was martyred for registering voters in Mississippi in 1955. Lee had tried for years to register to vote, and, when he finally succeeded, he worked tirelessly to help others defeat barriers to the ballot box. - @TeamKCP
The next pillar of our #IWillVote program: Register to vote. Even after the 15th Amendment gave Black Americans the vote, Jim Crow laws prevented many Black people from even registering to vote for nearly 100 years. - @TeamKCP
When Black voters commit to turning up on Election Day, amazing things happen. @KeishaBottoms and @LaToyaForNOLA were just elected mayors of Atlanta and New Orleans because they were able to engage our community in meaningful ways. - @TeamKCP https://t.co/M7pFJmHdlU
Then-U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions tried to stop them. In 1985 Evelyn &amp; Albert were falsely accused of altering absentee ballots. Sessions‚Äô long history of racism was on full display: the case against them was weak, and they were found not guilty. - @TeamKCP
Evelyn &amp; Albert Turner exemplify the first of our pillars: Commit to vote. By helping people vote with their absentee ballots, they were able to elect candidates to the school board and county commission in AL. - @TeamKCP #IWillVote
The 4 pillars of our #IWillVote program are Commit to Vote, Register to Vote, Protect the Vote, and Get Out the Vote. While Trump and his cronies create fake commissions to investigate problems that don‚Äôt exist, these activists are on the ground doing real work. - @TeamKCP
